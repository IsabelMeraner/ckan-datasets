It has 28 productive sectors (activities), 36 commodities, 10 households, 5 factors, a government account and a rest-of-the-world account. The SAM has a detailed treatment for agriculture, there are 14 agricultural sectors producing 22 agricultural commodities. Bread and flour are two commodities that are subsidized in Egypt. The SAM accounts for these commodities and splits them into subsidized and unsubsidized, a treatment that facilitates the analysis of food subsidy issues. The SAM also differentiates between urban and rural households by quintiles, allowing welfare, inequality and poverty analysis. In addition to land, the SAM distinguishes between agricultural and nonagricultural labor and capital.
