All this is just a result of the Bush administration's Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act that has been passed by a Republican congress in 2001. Still another provision of that act went in to effect on January 1st, 2006, a cross of a Roth IRA and a traditional 401k called the Roth 401k. \n\nStill another company sponsored savings plan, the newest Roth 401k works in very nearly precisely the same way as a conventional 401k plan. Workers invest a portion of the income into an account in addition to contributions from their employer (if any). The difference is that the standard 401k is financed with \"pre-tax\" dollars and the Roth 401k program uses \"after-tax\" dollars. However, with all the Roth 401(k), withdrawal of your money at retirement will be tax-free such as for instance a Roth IRA. The standard 401k approach defers the tax owed during your job until retirement. \n\nIt is very important to remember that no company must offer this new Roth 401(k) plan, though it may possibly seem like the best of both sides. Actually, a recent review by worker benefits consulting firm Hewitt and Associates discovered that only 31 % of companies currently offering the standard 401k strategy are looking at implementing the newest Roth 401k. \n\nContribution limits for the retirement plans are: in 2005, $14,000 for a and $4,000 for an, whether Roth or traditional.
