This thesis combines them and endeavor in the development of a general software for laser device based on FPGA and ARM, which is a professional control software combining the mechanical movement and laser control to actualize the combination of the technology of light, energy and electronic. This software may actualize powerful system function under the circumstance of offline, and forms a fairly complete system. There are convenient functions for the setting of the display of man-machine communication and system, man-machine communication, correcting parameter, documents management, easy system evolution function, and safe system protection function. What\u2019s more, the following system evolution is sufficiently considered when the program is designed, and rooms for system evolution optimization are obligated. The program absolutely adopts the modularization design system, and supplies great convenience for developing different versions and the migration.", "format": "aspx", "tracking_summary": {"total": 0, "recent": 0}, "mimetype_inner": "", "mimetype": "text/html", "cache_url": null, "name": "A General Software Development of Laser Device Based on FPGA and ARM", "created": "2013-05-14T02:29:13.824832", "url": "http://www.sj-ce.org/paperInfo.aspx?ID=693", "webstore_url": null, "last_modified": "2013-05-14T02:29:17.192324", "position": 0, "revision_id": "7f0e3bf9-fca3-42ed-86cd-46b14b72a5ff", "resource_type": "file"}], "num_resources": 1, "tags": [], "tracking_summary": {"total": 0, "recent": 0}, "groups": [], "organization": {"description": "", "created": "2013-10-10T14:24:46.556146", "title": "Global", "name": "global", "revision_timestamp": "2013-10-10T19:24:46.463952", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "6f9b4b38-6781-489c-bb4d-ea106ee7ac37", "type": "organization", "id": "94d03217-717d-41ce-a20c-00e754e94183", "approval_status": "approved"}, "relationships_as_subject": [], "num_tags": 0, "name": "a-general-software-development-of-laser-device-based-on-fpga-and-arm", "isopen": true, "url": "", "notes": "Laser incision technique is extensively applied in different areas due to its remarkable advantages, while FPGA and ARM are the elegant combination of high-level digitally electric products.
