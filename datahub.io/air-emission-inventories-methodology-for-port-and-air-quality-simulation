Conducting an air emission inventory is essential to design effective emission abatement strategies. The aims of this study are to calculate air emissions, modeling of air quality and discuss emission abatement strategies for Saigon port, Vietnam. Saigon Port within the port system of the Vietnam Maritime sector is one the port having the highest throughput and productivity in the country. The air quality in the area around the port is polluted. Then the air emissions results are used for modelling air quality in Saigon Port. The results of air quality modelling are used to design emissions abatement strategies. The results of air emission inventories show that total emissions of all pollutants are dominated by OGVs and harbor cranes. Emissions from OGVs are mainly during hotelling due to the long times spent at berth, while harbor cranes emissions are high because of the extended usage and high power rating. The results of air quality modeling using only air emission inventories from the port as input parameter show that concentration of air pollutants is lower than the Vietnamese technical regulation on ambient air quality. Only air emissions from Saigon port don\u2019t pollute the air surrounding area but if combined with other sources of emissions cause air pollution to the surrounding area.\r\n", "format": "aspx", "tracking_summary": {"total": 0, "recent": 0}, "mimetype_inner": "", "mimetype": "text/html", "cache_url": null, "name": "Air Emission Inventories Methodology for Port and Air Quality Simulation", "created": "2013-05-15T20:41:10.219395", "url": "http://www.ivypub.org/mt/paperInfo.aspx?ID=2977", "webstore_url": null, "last_modified": "2013-05-15T20:41:14.778316", "position": 0, "revision_id": "2527719a-9309-4af8-92a4-ccab4a1637b7", "resource_type": "file"}], "num_resources": 1, "tags": [], "tracking_summary": {"total": 0, "recent": 0}, "groups": [], "organization": {"description": "", "created": "2013-10-10T14:24:46.556146", "title": "Global", "name": "global", "revision_timestamp": "2013-10-10T19:24:46.463952", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "6f9b4b38-6781-489c-bb4d-ea106ee7ac37", "type": "organization", "id": "94d03217-717d-41ce-a20c-00e754e94183", "approval_status": "approved"}, "relationships_as_subject": [], "num_tags": 0, "name": "air-emission-inventories-methodology-for-port-and-air-quality-simulation", "isopen": true, "url": "", "notes": "Port activities can be a major source of air pollution.
