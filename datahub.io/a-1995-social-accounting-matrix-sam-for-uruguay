Previous experiences of building a SAM for Uruguay were based on 1983 data (El\u00edas, 1991; Laens & Rius, 1991). In the second half of the 80\u2019s and all along the 90\u2019s, significant changes occurred in the Uruguayan economy, so none of those SAMs were considered suitable for the analysis.\r\n\r\nThe task of building a new SAM was undertaken as a follow-up of the estimation of an input-output table (IOT95) at CINVE with 1995 data (Lorenzo et al., 1999). This IOT95 was chosen as the core of the SAM for 1995 (SAM95). The methodology used for the IOT95 is presented in detail in Lorenzo et al (1999), but as long as this document has not been sufficiently disseminated, we will briefly summarize here its main features.", "owner_org": "cfba7116-aec4-41d6-b54d-a6e1f23de942", "extras": [], "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/", "title": "A 1995 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for Uruguay", "revision_id": "e429cb77-b5ec-4f53-af43-340761fcdc2a"}
