The dataset contains a subset of locations and attributes of incidents reported in the ASAP (Analytical Services Application) crime report database by the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (MPD).\r\nWebsite: http://www.mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/cwp/view,a,1239,q,543329.asp\r\n\r\nAll statistics presented here are based on preliminary DC Code Index crime data. Data reflects crimes reported at least two business days before today's date. All statistics are subject to change due to a variety of reasons, such as a change in classification, the determination that certain offense reports were unfounded, or late reporting. Please note that reporting the data almost \"real-time\" to the public means that there is an expected error rate up to +/- 10% on the preliminary data. The MPDC is working aggressively to improve the accuracy of the historical and current data, and to launch new technology and processes to reduce the error rate in 2008. In the meantime, MPDC has concluded that having this information available to the public is preferable to removing the data entirely from the web.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the preliminary data do not represent official statistics submitted to the FBI under the Uniform Crime Reporting program (UCR). All preliminary offenses are coded based on DC Code and not the FBI offense classifications. Any comparisons between DC Code preliminary data and the official crime statistics published by the FBI under the UCR Program are inaccurate and misleading because of expected differences between local and national offense classifications. The MPDC does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information. The MPDC will not be responsible for any error or omission, or for the use of, or the results obtained from the use of this information. All data visualizations on maps should be considered approximate, and attempts to derive specific addresses are strictly prohibited. The reports provided by this application include only events that can be mapped. This limitation excludes approximately 3 percent of the data.\r\n\r\nAs part of Chief Cathy Lanier\u2019s dedication to improving crime data tracking and analysis, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) recently upgraded key data systems. As a result of these upgrades, the crime data for 2006 and 2007 has been changed. All data downloaded through http://crimemap.dc.gov or through any of the Live Data Feeds made available on http://data.octo.dc.gov/ prior to 01/28/2008 should be deleted and replaced with the updated data now available on these sites.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it should be noted that individual records of crimes are subject to change as a result of further review and investigation. Anyone downloading data through any of the Live Data Feeds should track and remove records that are flagged as \"Removed\" in subsequent data downloads.\r\n\r\nSee Use Constraints and Data Accuracy Report for further details.", "owner_org": null, "extras": [{"key": "Metadata", "value": "http://data.dc.gov/Metadata.aspx?id=3", "__extras": {"package_id": "0cf42b80-398b-4924-9225-90c708e9e591", "revision_id": "67af3340-0045-4f76-ab3b-325a44aaf18e"}}], "title": "311 Service Requests", "revision_id": "67af3340-0045-4f76-ab3b-325a44aaf18e"}
