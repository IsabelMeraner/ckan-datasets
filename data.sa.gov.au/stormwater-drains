We provide practical advice to government, industry and communities to achieve productive and balanced use of natural resources and to help improve the condition and resilience of our natural systems.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with communities and a diverse range of partners to help them make good decisions about how our natural resources are used and managed, and to help South Australians care for the land, water and sea that sustain us.", "created": "2013-03-13T15:24:15.732651", "title": "Dept of Environment, Water and Natural Resources", "name": "dept-of-environment-water-and-natural-resources", "revision_timestamp": "2013-09-09T06:45:58.656025", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/0/332/global-dewnr-logo.png", "revision_id": "3589addc-fdca-4bd4-b281-bde6938ce71f", "type": "organization", "id": "f472308e-5e13-4c92-95d6-17eab5a470c0", "approval_status": "approved"}, "relationships_as_subject": [], "num_tags": 2, "name": "stormwater-drains", "isopen": true, "url": null, "notes": "The Stormwater Drains dataset has been derived by updating the 2005 dataset with data obtained from Local Government Councils.", "owner_org": "f472308e-5e13-4c92-95d6-17eab5a470c0", "extras": [], "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/", "title": "Stormwater Drains", "revision_id": "6a1702c1-57c1-4e49-a57b-e3451ad79587"}
