We provide practical advice to government, industry and communities to achieve productive and balanced use of natural resources and to help improve the condition and resilience of our natural systems.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with communities and a diverse range of partners to help them make good decisions about how our natural resources are used and managed, and to help South Australians care for the land, water and sea that sustain us.", "created": "2013-03-13T15:24:15.732651", "title": "Dept of Environment, Water and Natural Resources", "name": "dept-of-environment-water-and-natural-resources", "revision_timestamp": "2013-09-09T06:45:58.656025", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/0/332/global-dewnr-logo.png", "revision_id": "3589addc-fdca-4bd4-b281-bde6938ce71f", "type": "organization", "id": "f472308e-5e13-4c92-95d6-17eab5a470c0", "approval_status": "approved"}, "relationships_as_subject": [], "num_tags": 4, "name": "pools-or-dams-greater-than-15m", "isopen": true, "url": null, "notes": "This dataset portrays all of the pools or dams with a length greater than 15m visible in 3rd order streams and greater in the Mount Lofty Ranges.", "owner_org": "f472308e-5e13-4c92-95d6-17eab5a470c0", "extras": [], "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/", "title": "Pools or Dams Greater than 15m", "revision_id": "d8567966-272d-4996-867d-e9eaa0e3c650"}
