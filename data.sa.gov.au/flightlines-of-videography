The issues we work on include water security, climate change, sustainable land management, public estate management and biodiversity conservation. We provide practical advice to government, industry and communities to achieve productive and balanced use of natural resources and to help improve the condition and resilience of our natural systems.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with communities and a diverse range of partners to help them make good decisions about how our natural resources are used and managed, and to help South Australians care for the land, water and sea that sustain us.", "created": "2013-03-13T15:24:15.732651", "title": "Dept of Environment, Water and Natural Resources", "name": "dept-of-environment-water-and-natural-resources", "revision_timestamp": "2013-09-09T06:45:58.656025", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/0/332/global-dewnr-logo.png", "revision_id": "3589addc-fdca-4bd4-b281-bde6938ce71f", "type": "organization", "id": "f472308e-5e13-4c92-95d6-17eab5a470c0", "approval_status": "approved"}, "relationships_as_subject": [], "num_tags": 4, "name": "flightlines-of-videography", "isopen": true, "url": null, "notes": "Digital video imagery of 3,800km of watercourses within the Mount Lofty Ranges was captured with the use of a gyro-stabilised digital video camera installed on the underside of a helicopter.
