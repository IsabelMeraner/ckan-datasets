We provide practical advice to government, industry and communities to achieve productive and balanced use of natural resources and to help improve the condition and resilience of our natural systems.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with communities and a diverse range of partners to help them make good decisions about how our natural resources are used and managed, and to help South Australians care for the land, water and sea that sustain us.", "created": "2013-03-13T15:24:15.732651", "title": "Dept of Environment, Water and Natural Resources", "name": "dept-of-environment-water-and-natural-resources", "revision_timestamp": "2013-09-09T06:45:58.656025", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/0/332/global-dewnr-logo.png", "revision_id": "3589addc-fdca-4bd4-b281-bde6938ce71f", "type": "organization", "id": "f472308e-5e13-4c92-95d6-17eab5a470c0", "approval_status": "approved"}, "relationships_as_subject": [], "num_tags": 2, "name": "marine-park-network-coordinates", "isopen": true, "url": null, "notes": "This dataset identifies the longitude and latitude of the South Australian Marine Park outer boundaries at different locations within the state.", "owner_org": "f472308e-5e13-4c92-95d6-17eab5a470c0", "extras": [], "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/", "title": "Marine Park Network Coordinates", "revision_id": "464da044-88cd-4f11-8131-05e3f66387e6"}
