The larger Ribble catchment includes all of the land that drains into the Ribble Estuary: five main rivers and their tributaries and the Crossens drainage system. The Ribble rises in the Pennines, and flowing east for 100km before running into the Irish Sea, it is one of the longest rivers in the North West, draining a catchment of 2128 sq km (860 sq miles).\nThe catchment has a population of 1.25 million, concentrated in a few urban areas including Preston, Blackburn, Wigan, and Blackpool, with the rest of the catchment (90%) predominantly rural. Agricultural activity is extensive throughout the Ribble area. The uplands above Settle and the Trough of Bowland are largely sheep farming areas with dairy predominating on the lower river. In the upland catchment, the farming is based around small villages. However, some upland farms are located on permeable limestone so spillages and other releases of pollutants can enter groundwater quickly, and re-emerge in surface waters deteriorating water quality. The problem is compounded by the soil of the Ribble area being predominantly clay, which increases the diffuse pollution from agricultural run-off.\nThe mid Ribble is joined south of Clitheroe by two major tributaries: the Hodder and the Calder. The River Hodder rises in the Forest of Bowland where it is dammed near to its source to form Stocks Reservoir, which provides a large proportion of drinking water for the Blackburn area. This 25-mile river is mainly upland in characteristics, surrounded by sheep-grazed fells. The River Calder, crossing East Lancashire, contrasts to the Hodder in that it is a post-industrialised river, exhibiting pollution from relics of mining, contaminated land run-off and sewage discharges. Retaining walls, weirs and culverts constrain parts of the river as it flows through the industrial towns of Burnley, Nelson and Colne where the river was used to power the regions cotton mills and their accompanying bleaching and dyeing works.\nThe key urban areas within the catchment lie in the industrialised areas of East Lancashire adjacent to the River Calder and Darwen, such as Burnley, Nelson and Blackburn; and also in the lower reaches of the River Ribble at Preston and Walton-le-Dale. There are also numerous dispersed villages in the upper catchment, with some larger towns such as Settle, Clitheroe and Ribchester located in the middle to upper catchment. The industrial legacy of the Ribble catchment is evident in areas of East Lancashire where industrial buildings such as mills and factories were built over rivers, creating numerous culverted watercourses.\nBoth urban and rural activities have all had an impact upon the water quality and quantity of the Ribble. Historically, the landscape has also been modified as watercourses and wetlands were altered to improve land drainage. The general pressures on land and water include: The development and growth of urban areas; Transport networks criss-crossing the catchment; Changing agricultural markets and the intensification of agriculture, especially in the context of diffuse water pollution; The use of land by extractive industries across the river basin from limestone in the head-waters to sand extraction in the estuary; Water abstraction in parts of the catchment, leading to low flow problems.\n", "owner_org": null, "extras": [{"key": "INSPIRE", "value": "True", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[]", "__extras": {"revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3", "package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8"}}, {"key": "bbox-east-long", "value": "2.687637", "__extras": {"revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3", "package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8"}}, {"key": "bbox-north-lat", "value": "60.850441", "__extras": {"revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3", "package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8"}}, {"key": "bbox-south-lat", "value": "49.83726", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "bbox-west-long", "value": "-9.227701", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "contact-email", "value": "paul1@ceh.ac.uk", "__extras": {"revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3", "package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8"}}, {"key": "coupled-resource", "value": "[]", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "dataset-reference-date", "value": "[{\"type\": \"creation\", \"value\": \"2011-05-19\"}]", "__extras": {"revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3", "package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8"}}, {"key": "frequency-of-update", "value": "unknown", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "guid", "value": "b6c535ad-d077-4407-a62e-c89eaae1903e", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "7a9df1d1-1101-425d-9d59-9de07e966d2f", "__extras": {"revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3", "package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8"}}, {"key": "licence", "value": "[]", "__extras": {"revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3", "package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8"}}, {"key": "metadata-date", "value": "2011-07-12", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "metadata-language", "value": "eng", "__extras": {"revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3", "package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8"}}, {"key": "published_by", "value": "18487", "__extras": {"revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3", "package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8"}}, {"key": "resource-type", "value": "series", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "responsible-party", "value": "Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (pointOfContact)", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "spatial", "value": "{\"type\":\"Polygon\",\"coordinates\":[[[2.687637, 49.83726],[2.687637, 60.850441], [-9.227701, 60.850441], [-9.227701, 49.83726], [2.687637, 49.83726]]]}", "__extras": {"revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3", "package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8"}}, {"key": "spatial-data-service-type", "value": "", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "spatial-reference-system", "value": "", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "temporal_coverage-from", "value": "[]", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}, {"key": "temporal_coverage-to", "value": "[]", "__extras": {"package_id": "b189ee9e-fb4b-4129-8337-1cf29bfd92a8", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}}], "title": "CEH Research Priority Catchments: The Ribble and Wyre catchments", "revision_id": "a98a2033-1e62-4640-8485-7354cbc183f3"}
