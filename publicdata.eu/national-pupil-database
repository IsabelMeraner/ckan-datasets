From 30 July, interested parties can request extracts of data from the National Pupil Database (NPD) using the application pack available on the Department for Education website.\r\n \r\nOver the last ten years extracts of the data have been shared under strict terms and conditions with named bodies and third parties who require data for research into the educational achievement of pupils. The data has provided invaluable evidence on educational performance to inform independent research, as well as analysis carried out or commissioned by the Department. The improved access arrangements aim to encourage more organisations to request access to the data for educational research, maximising the value of this rich dataset.\r\n\r\nThe Department has developed a number of standard extracts which they hope will fulfil many peoples\u2019 needs and speed up access to the data. The extracts have been organised into four different tiers of access, each with their own governance arrangements. More information on standard extracts and a full list of data items available in each tier, including new information at School level, can be found in the data tables on the NPD web page. \r\n\r\nCustomers with more complex requirements can still request a bespoke extract of the data. All applications will go through a robust approval process and those granted access will be subject, as before, to strict terms and conditions on the security, handling and use of the data, including compliance with the Data Protection Act.  Anyone requesting access to the most sensitive data will also be required to submit a business case and provide additional information about their security arrangements.  \r\n\r\nYou will find full details of the application process including the new NPD User Guide and Protocol, NPD Data Requests Application Pack and Data Security Self-Assessment form on the NPD web page at: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.education.gov.uk/researchandstatistics/national-pupil-database/b00212283/national-pupil-database. \r\n\r\n", "owner_org": null, "extras": [{"key": "contact-name", "value": "www.education.gov.uk", "__extras": {"package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa", "revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56"}}, {"key": "eu_country", "value": "UK", "__extras": {"revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56", "package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa"}}, {"key": "geographic_coverage", "value": "100000: England", "__extras": {"revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56", "package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa"}}, {"key": "harvest_catalogue_name", "value": "Data.gov.uk", "__extras": {"package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa", "revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56"}}, {"key": "harvest_catalogue_url", "value": "http://data.gov.uk", "__extras": {"package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa", "revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56"}}, {"key": "harvest_dataset_url", "value": "http://data.gov.uk/dataset/7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa", "__extras": {"package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa", "revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56"}}, {"key": "mandate", "value": "", "__extras": {"revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56", "package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa"}}, {"key": "temporal_coverage-from", "value": "", "__extras": {"package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa", "revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56"}}, {"key": "temporal_coverage-to", "value": "", "__extras": {"revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56", "package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa"}}, {"key": "theme-primary", "value": "Education", "__extras": {"package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa", "revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56"}}, {"key": "theme-secondary", "value": "Education", "__extras": {"package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa", "revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56"}}, {"key": "update_frequency", "value": "", "__extras": {"revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56", "package_id": "7f796b70-298b-4b43-99a9-c63d082ad5aa"}}], "title": "National Pupil Database", "revision_id": "40799240-5f57-4252-8d3f-714e85063c56"}
