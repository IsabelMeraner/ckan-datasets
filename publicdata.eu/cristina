However, i have recently discovered that Veola are no longer collecting on my road (Evelyn Road). Yet the road next to mine is going to receive 4-weekly collections. After speaking to the council, they claim the van has access issues. However the black bin collection lorry and the blue bin lorry manage perfectly fine. The real reason is that 20% of the city's roads will no longer receive green bag collections due to cut backs. We are advised to take it to our local recycling center (S5) or have a compost bin. I'd like to know if the council are going to provide a discount on my bill for the service which i am no longer getting. This will pay towards the petrol to take it to the recycling center. I'm also concerned for people on my road who don't have a car and the elderly people in the area who can't easily carry their waste. Do the council intend to reinstate the collections some time soon? Personally, I'd rather go back to the old service where you can call someone to collect your bags when you have them ready. At least that way they were actually collected.
