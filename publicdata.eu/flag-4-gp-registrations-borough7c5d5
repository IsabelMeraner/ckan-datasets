The patient register is a 'snapshot' taken annually.&nbsp; When an in-migrant subsequently moves internally within the UK and re-registers with a second GP, the Flag 4 demarcation is not retained as the individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last residence is now within the UK. If this internal migration occurs within the year of in-migration, i.e. before the next mid-year snapshot, the in-migration will not be recorded.GP registration is not compulsory. Some migrants will only register with a GP if, and when, they require medical attention. There may also be a lag between the migration event and the eventual GP registration.The completeness of the data depends on all patients registering with an NHS GP when they move to the England and Wales. However, it is known that registration patterns vary by sex and age group. Therefore, the usefulness of the data as an indicator of migration is limited by some groups being less likely to register with a GP than others. For example, young men (who make up a large proportion of migrants) are less likely to register with a GP than other groups.</p>\r\\\n<p>For more information&nbsp; please contact: <a href=\"mailto:Migstatsunit@ons.gov.uk\">Migstatsunit@ons.gov.uk</a></p>", "owner_org": null, "extras": [{"key": "categories", "value": "{Demographics}", "__extras": {"package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230", "revision_id": "5b6bcd2a-5281-4d0f-8182-eb51f1080019"}}, {"key": "date_released", "value": "Jun-11", "__extras": {"revision_id": "5b6bcd2a-5281-4d0f-8182-eb51f1080019", "package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230"}}, {"key": "eu_country", "value": "UK", "__extras": {"revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec", "package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230"}}, {"key": "eu_nuts1", "value": "UKI", "__extras": {"revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec", "package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230"}}, {"key": "geographical_coverage", "value": "Greater London", "__extras": {"package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230", "revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec"}}, {"key": "geographical_granularity", "value": "Local Authority", "__extras": {"package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230", "revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec"}}, {"key": "harvest_catalogue_name", "value": "London Datastore", "__extras": {"revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec", "package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230"}}, {"key": "harvest_catalogue_url", "value": "http://data.london.gov.uk", "__extras": {"package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230", "revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec"}}, {"key": "harvest_dataset_url", "value": "http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/package/flag-4-gp-registrations-borough", "__extras": {"revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec", "package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230"}}, {"key": "license_details", "value": "", "__extras": {"package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230", "revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec"}}, {"key": "license_summary", "value": "", "__extras": {"package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230", "revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec"}}, {"key": "spatial_reference_system", "value": "", "__extras": {"revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec", "package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230"}}, {"key": "temporal_coverage", "value": "2000-2010", "__extras": {"revision_id": "5b6bcd2a-5281-4d0f-8182-eb51f1080019", "package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230"}}, {"key": "temporal_granularity", "value": "Annually", "__extras": {"package_id": "3531e21db2f3f94574db657d817017a68628c230", "revision_id": "7c8a9891-aa18-4876-9c1f-648300fc54ec"}}], "title": "Flag 4 GP Registrations, Borough", "revision_id": "5b6bcd2a-5281-4d0f-8182-eb51f1080019"}
