A sample station in this context is the site of a sea-bed sample/core or observation. It includes sea-bed samples, shallow cores and geotechnical-type boreholes, but not hydrocarbon wells. There are basically 2 types of sample stations - those occupied during BGS mapping projects and those resulting from projects conducted by other governmental, academic or commercial organisations. The amount of metadata available varies depending on the source of the information, but as a minimum will include the sample station name, its geographical co-ordinates and a source of further descriptive or analytical information. For sample stations occupied by BGS the index will include the date, water depth, total depth penetrated below sea bed, equipment types used and summary geological description. The sample stations are mainly located on the UKCS (United Kingdom Continental Shelf) and surrounding areas, although there are sample stations recorded from other parts of the world also. The bulk of the sample stations were occupied in the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and early 1990's with ongoing additions of new sample stations. The distribution is very variable, but, in general, there are sample stations spaced about every 5 - 10km across the entire UK Continental Shelf. In some localised areas the sampling density is much higher. For BGS sample stations, the metadata were recorded at the time of sampling or shortly afterwards. For non-BGS stations, the data have been compiled from a variety of sources, mainly by extracting relevant information from reports and other documents made available to BGS. The data were manually entered via forms into the index. The index is applicable to a wide range of uses including environmental, geotechnical and geological studies.", "owner_org": null, "extras": [{"key": "INSPIRE", "value": "True", "__extras": {"revision_id": "cda8d9e8-1bc0-40e5-a0fb-1f83d8a084dd", "package_id": "fe01a88c-4f2c-4640-9838-6f8ba6479105"}}, {"key": "UKLP", "value": "True", "__extras": {"revision_id": "bec0a56f-f54e-41c7-a3da-c4ed8763e693", "package_id": "fe01a88c-4f2c-4640-9838-6f8ba6479105"}}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[\"license: Either : (i) the dataset has not been formally approved by BGS for access and use by external clients under license; and / or (ii) the dataset contains 3rd party data or information obtained by BGS under terms and conditions that must be consulted before the dataset can be provided to, or accessed by, BGS staff or external clients.
