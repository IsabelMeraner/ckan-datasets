The prohibition must be in the form of a city ordinance, or a restrictive covenant that is enforceable by the city and filed in the property records. The program ID is the application number and is the data set's key field labled as \"MSD_APPLIC\". The MSD_Boundary data set is a compilation of the real properties boundaries that applicants to the MSD program have designated as 'proposed\" MSD areas. This data set has been created to show the geograhical area the applicant has applied for an MSD under the program . Each area is identified by the program's application ID (ie. MSD AP 001). This data set corresponds to the MSDs_Point shape file which uses the same application number and key field name \"MSD_APPLIC\". The point coordinates are the approximate centroid of the proposed MDS area(s).\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that points be referenced for additional information on the polygons if needed.", "owner_org": "d4355678-90a1-4413-9aed-5bfe6d583077", "extras": [], "title": "Municipal Designation Sites Boundaries ", "revision_id": "ef958eb5-fb25-4b97-a96f-db459d433ec5"}
