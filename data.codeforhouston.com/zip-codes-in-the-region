This file covers the area of eight counties: Harris, Fortbend, Montgomery, Chambers, Liberty, Brazoria, Galveston, and Waller. Line features include roads, railroads, hydrography, miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines, pipe lines, and boundaries. Street address attributes are located on the arcs. Areas used to tabulate the 2000 census statistical data and current geographic areas are also included as regions. There are three region subclasses: blocks(BLK2000), block groups(GRP2000), and census tracts(TRT2000). The original layer \"pdgis.zipcodes\" is unmodified. This version has many duplicate arcs along streams and waterways removed for improved cartographic display. Many of the attributes are stored in coded form. The user is encouraged to consult the appropriate U.S. Census Bureau documentation when necessary. See the TIGER/Line Geographic Names files for a list of geographic entity codes and names. Also see FIPS Publication 55-3, Codes For Names Populated Places, Primary Division, and Other Locations of the United States for a list of entity codes, names and class codes that identify each entity's type and status. For the convenience of the user, the following are the FIPS county codes for the included counties: Brazos, 39; Chambers, 71; Fort Bend, 157; Galveston, 167; Harris, 201; Liberty, 291; Montgomery,339; Waller, 473. These are the codes contained in the COUNTY field of the polygons and regions, and the COUNTYR and COUNTYL field of the arcs.\r\n \r\nDescription\r\nU.S. Census Bureau's TIGER 2000 - Zipcode\r\n \r\nCredits\r\nThere are no credits for this item.\r\n \r\nUse limitations\r\nDisclaimer: COHIGS data is prepared and made available for general reference purposes only and should not be used, or relied upon for specific applications, without independent verification.
