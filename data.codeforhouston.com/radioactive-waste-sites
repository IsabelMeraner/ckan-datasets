According to this standard, 90% of well-defined features tested must be within 12 meters. The layer also complies with all TCEQ Agency Standards.\r\n\r\n1.2.2 Purpose:\r\nThe TCEQ Radioactive Waste Sites layer is used to identify the geographic Radioactive Waste sites within the State of Texas. This data layer can be used for a variety of purposes, including: the plotting of Radioactive Waste sites on maps; utilization by field personnel; and performing spatial analysis on how the sites affect their surroundings.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Supplemental_Information:\r\nThe radioactive waste sites listed in this coverage were identified visually by TCEQ program area personnel in Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangle (DOQQ)-based maps provided by the TCEQ GIS Team. In some cases additional documentation of the site locations were provided by the site points of contact. Once identified, the horizontal positional coordinates for these sites were obtained by displaying the appropriate DOQQs in ArcView and using the Display Coordinates Tool to obtain the coordinates.\r\n\r\nThe radioactive waste sites, DOQQs utilized, and supplemental information are listed below:\r\n\r\nASARCO\r\nSettegast -- SE DOQQ. The physical location of this site was visually identified on the DOQQ by the TCEQ Program area. The site is a rectangular structure oriented north- south just to the east of IH-610 and south of Market Street. The coordinates were taken from the SW corner of the structure.\r\nBergstrom AFB\r\nMontopolis -- SE DOQQ. The physical location of this site was visually identified on the DOQQ from maps provided by the TCEQ Program Area. The site is a square pit located to the north of Burleson Road and west of the southern end of the main runway 17R/35L. The coordinates were taken from the SW corner of the site.\r\nDow Chemical\r\nFreeport -- NW DOQQ. The physical location of this site was visually identified on the DOQQ by the TCEQ Program area. The site is a square waste pit on the northeast shore of the Dow Barge Canal. The coordinates were taken from the SW corner of the waste pit.\r\nGrayson County College Golf Course\r\nSherman NW -- NE DOQQ. The physical location of this site was derived from documents and maps provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The site is a low-level radiation area on the western side of gravel road east of the golf course. The site is a rectangle oriented north- south with dimensions of roughly 100 x 200 feet. The coordinates were taken from the center of the site.\r\nHastings 1 -- Old Filling Station\r\nFriendswood -- SW DOQQ. The physical location of this site was visually identified on the DOQQ by the TCEQ Program area. The site is a small structure near an abandoned filling station on the eastern side of State Highway 35. The coordinates were taken from the SW corner of the structure.\r\nHastings 2 -- Five Acres Open Land\r\nAlgoa -- NE DOQQ. The physical location of this site was visually identified on the DOQQ from maps provided by the TCEQ Program area. This site location is a rectangular site on the southern edge of FM 518 and southeast of Old Road. The coordinates were taken from the SW corner of the site.\r\nHouston Gamma Ray\r\nHouston Heights -- SE DOQQ. The physical location of this site was visually identified on the DOQQ by the TCEQ Program area. The site is a small structure on the eastern side of T.C. Jester Blvd. and north of Schuler. The coordinates were taken from the SW corner of the structure.\r\nIso-Tex\r\nFriendswood -- SW DOQQ. The physical location of this site was visually identified on the DOQQ by the TCEQ Program area.

The site is a rectangular waste pit oriented east-west that lies on the western side of Bednyk Road and north of Bahler Avenue. The coordinates were taken from the center of the site.\r\nSolutia, Inc.\r\nHoskins Mound -- NW, NE and Mustang Bayou -- SW, SE DOQQs. The physical location of this site was visually identified on the DOQQ from maps provided by the TCEQ Program Area. There are three radioactive waste sites on the Solutia Plant grounds; all are square or rectangular pits. The coordinates were taken from the Solutia plant main entrance.\r\nTexas A&M\r\nWellborn -- NW DOQQ. Three rectangular radioactive waste sites are located in a landfill located to the southeast of Easterwood Field, and west of FM 2818. The field boundaries are identified in maps provided by the TCEQ Program Area, and are visible in the DOQQ. The coordinates were taken from the center of the landfill.\r\nTexas State Technical College\r\nElm Mott -- SW DOQQ. The physical location of this site was visually identified on the DOQQ by the TCEQ Program area. The site is a square waste pit located to the northeast of the TSTI Airport runways.
