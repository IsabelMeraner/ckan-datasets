Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc. Int.-Archive Interval: The archive interval used to store measurements.

All the weather stations have a standard set of sensors monitoring rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction and barometric pressure as part of an integrated system.

Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc. Int.-Archive Interval: The archive interval used to store measurements.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc. Int.-Archive Interval: The archive interval used to store measurements.

Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc.

All the weather stations have a standard set of sensors monitoring rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction and barometric pressure as part of an integrated system.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero.

Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.

If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.

ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body.

(1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc.

All the weather stations have a standard set of sensors monitoring rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction and barometric pressure as part of an integrated system.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc.

Each weather station logged measurements at half hour intervals. \n\n Two stations at each site were chosen to allow for a high degree of spatial resolution, particularly for rainfall. The weather data combined with the in-situ soil measurements allow the assessment of the seasonal variations of the geophysical soil properties and vegetation mark formation as a result of varying weather patterns with the aim to identify the biggest contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix and to predict when these occur as a result of weather.

Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc.

All the weather stations have a standard set of sensors monitoring rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction and barometric pressure as part of an integrated system. At each site 1 of the weather stations had an additional Solar and UV radiation sensor which can be used for estimation of evapotranspiration (2 stations in total).

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc. Int.-Archive Interval: The archive interval used to store measurements.  This is set to 30 minutes.", "spatial.boundingBox.WGS84.northLatitude": "52.278687", "resource.distribution.technique": "Download only", "resource.creator.name": "Laura Pring", "resource.metadata.creator.email": "dxb043@bham.ac.uk", "resource_group_id": "abe0605b-97b4-4702-934b-f1bdb473aa96", "resource.repositoryName": "http://dartportal.leeds.ac.uk/", "resource.reuseConstraints": "No conditions apply for reuse (remix it, publish it, share it, commercialise it, sell it etc.) except attribution (see resource.bibliographicCitation)", "resource.localURI": "http://dartportal.leeds.ac.uk/dart_public/dart_monitoring_weather_data/dart_wtr_ddpf_201106071230_201303261330_raw.zip", "spatial.boundingBox.OSGB36.east": "519746", "spatial.boundingBox.OSGB36.referenceSystem": "OSGB36", "id": "8c47647a-41ed-474e-ac3e-fda483217460", "temporal.rangeDescribedByDataDateTime.start": "2013", "resource.custodian.name": "Anthony Beck", "resource.custodian.orcID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2991-811X", "resource.type.specific": "Text", "spatial": "{ \"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [ [ [-0.259981, 52.278687],[-0.246205, 52.278687], [-0.246205, 52.271939], [-0.259981, 52.271939], [-0.259981, 52.278687] ] ] }", "resource.fileFormat": "zip", "resource.lineage": "None: this is raw data", "spatial.boundingBox.WGS84.referenceSystem": "WGS84", "resource.accessConstraints": "None", "resource.license": "odc-by", "instrument.measurementDomainAndUnits": "temperature in degrees centigrade, wind speed in m/s, pressure in millibar, rainfall in mm, solar radiation in W/m2, relative humidity", "tracking_summary": {"total": 0, "recent": 0}, "temporal.rangeDescribedByDataDateTime.end": "2011", "resource.type": "Dataset", "url": "http://dartportal.leeds.ac.uk/dart_public/dart_monitoring_weather_data/dart_wtr_ddpf_201106071230_201303261330_raw.zip", "spatial.driftGeology": "http://www.bgs.ac.uk/Lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=T1T2", "resource.relatedResources": "DartProjectOverview", "webstore_url": null, "resource_type": null, "spatial.landuse": "Permanent pasture", "position": 13}, {"resource.funder": "Science and Heritage Programme, Arts and Humanities Research Council, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "spatial.boundingBox.OSGB36.west": "406483", "resource.creator.email": "LEP001@bham.ac.uk", "resource.abstract": "Processing scripts", "title.alternative": "dart_monitoring_weather_data", "instrument": "Davis Instruments Vantage Pro2 weather station wired console and Integrated Sensor suite with additional solar radiation sensor", "resource.purpose": "multi-temporal heritage detection", "format": "ZIP", "mimetype_inner": null, "resource.processingStage": "Complete", "spatial.polygon.WGS84": "{ \"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [ [ [-1.907587, 51.706954],[-1.89939, 51.706954], [-1.89939, 51.703178], [-1.907587, 51.703178], [-1.907587, 51.706954] ] ] }", "name": "dart_wtr_hhqf_2011_2013_scripts.zip", "spatial.boundingBox.WGS84.eastLongitude": "-1.89939", "instrument.headerMetadata": "", "revision_id": "65d5191a-e0e7-43ee-a192-a322afe5a490", "title.pattern": "Where appropriate each resource has been named with the following pattern: DART_<3 character sensor/collection name>_<spatial location>_<StartDateTime YYYYMMDD with optional HHMM>_<endDateTime YYYYMMDD with optional HHMM>_<stage PRO or RAW to refer to processed or raw data>_<other stuff>.<suffix>.

The weather data combined with the in-situ soil measurements allow the assessment of the seasonal variations of the geophysical soil properties and vegetation mark formation as a result of varying weather patterns with the aim to identify the biggest contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix and to predict when these occur as a result of weather. This may lead to being able to predict when the biggest contrast occurs \n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TDR PROBES AND SETTINGS: Archive interval every 30 minutes.  \n\n Readings are taken using a Davis instruments Vantage Pro weather station with integrated sensor suite including temperature, humidity, rainfall, anemometer Solar radiation sensor and barometer.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value. Instead of sampling the humidity and deriving an 'average humidity' for the hour, each time the temperature is sampled, the value of the saturation vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure are calculated from the current values of temperature and humidity and sampled. These vapor pressure values (in kPa) are used to compute the average saturation vapor pressure and the average water vapor pressure for the hour. The Vantage has the capability to perform floating point arithmetic.  \n\n Wind Samp: The number of wind samples.  \n\n Wind TX-wind transmitter ID: The Id number for the anemometer used to measure the wind.  Is always 1 as only a single anemometer sensor is used.  \n\n ISS Recept: The signal strength between the consoles from the integrated sensor suite (ISS).  \n\n Arc. Int.-Archive Interval: The archive interval used to store measurements.

Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  \n\n Hi Temp : Temparature High: The highest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Low Temp : Temperature Low: The lowest recorded temperature from outside in the archive interval.  \n\n Out Hum : Outside Humidity: Humidity itself simply refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. However, the total amount of water vapor that the air can contain varies with air temperature and pressure.  Relative humidity takes into account these factors and offers a humidity reading which reflects the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the amount the air is capable of holding. Relative humidity, therefore, is not actually a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, but a ratio of the air's water vapor content to its capacity.  When we use the term humidity in the manual and on the screen, we mean relative humidity.  It is important to realize that relative humidity changes with temperature, pressure, and water vapor content. A parcel of air with a capacity for 10 g of water vapor which contains4 g of water vapor, the relative humidity would be 40percent. Adding 2 g more water vapor (for a total of 6 g) would change the humidity to 60percent. If that same parcel of air is then warmed so that it has a capacity for 20 g of water vapor, the relative humidity drops to 30percent even though water vapor content does not change.  Relative humidity is an important factor in determining the amount of evaporation from plants and wet surfaces since warm air with low humidity has a large capacity to absorb extra water vapor.  \n\n Dew Pt. : Dew Point: Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation (100percent relative humidity) to occur, providing there is no change in water content. Dew point is calculated at the end of each archive interval based on temperature and relative humidity.  \n\n Wind Speed : Wind Speed: The average speed of the wind taken over the archive interval.  Measured in km/h.  \n\n Wind Dir : Wind Direction: The weather station records the direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speed is above zero.  \n\n Wind Run : Wind Run: The amount of wind in kilometres passing the station within the archive interval.  Wind run is calculated by multiplying the avarage wind speed for the archive interval by the time of the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Speed : Wind Speed High: The highest recorded wind speed over the archive interval.  \n\n Hi Dir : Wind Direction High: The direction the wind is coming from as a compass reading when the wind speeds at its peak speed within the archive interval.  \n\n Wind Chill-calculated wind chill temperature: The weather station uses the Osczevski (1995) equation to calculate wind chill using the air temperature and wind speed.  \n\n Heat Index-calculated heat index: Heat Index recorded from outside. This uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.' When humidity is low, the apparent temperature will be lower than the air temperature, since perspiration evaporates rapidly to cool the body. However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n THW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity--Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n THSW Index-Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index: The Temperature-Humidity-Sun-Wind Index uses humidity and temperature to calculate an apparent temperature.  In addition, THSW incorporates the heating effects of solar radiation and the cooling effects of wind (like wind chill) on our perception of temperature. Formula was developed by Steadman (1979).  \n\n Bar-Barometric pressure: The atmospheric pressure corrected to an equivalent sea level value recorded using the weather station sensor in millibars.  \n\n Rain: The amount of rainfall recorded in an archive interval recorded by the weather station.  Rainfall is logger by counting the number of times the 0.2mm rain gauge bucket is tipped during the measurement period.  Rain Rate: Under normal conditions (see packet sequencing below) rain rate data is sent with a nominal interval of 10 to 12 seconds. Every time a rain tip or click occurs, a new rain rate value is computed (from the timer values) and the rate timers are reset to zero. Rain rate is calculated based on the time between successive tips of the rain collector. The rain rate value is the highest rate since the last transmitted rain rate data packet. (Under most conditions, however, a rain tip will not occur every 10 to 12 seconds.)  If there have been no rain tips since the last rain rate data transmission, then the rain rate based on the time since that last tip is indicated. This results in slowly decaying rate values as a rain storm ends, instead of showing a rain rate which abruptly drops to zero. This results in a more realistic representation of the actual rain event.  \n\n Solar Rad.-Average Solar Radiation: Current solar radiation is technically known as Global Solar Radiation, a measure of the intensity of the sun's radiation reaching a horizontal surface. This irradiance includes both the direct component from the sun and the reflected component from the rest of the sky. The solar radiation reading gives a measure of the amount of solar radiation hitting the solar radiation sensor at any given time, expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2). Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Solar Energy: The amount of accumulated solar radiation energy over a period of time is measured in Langleys. (1 Langley  = 11.622 Watt-hours per square meter).  Calculated from solar radiation readings.  Solar radiation requires the solar radiation sensor.  \n\n Hi Solar Rad.-High Solar Radiation: The maximum solar radiation recorded by the sensor during an archive interval expressed in Watts/sq. meter (W/m2).  Heat D-D-Heating degree days: One heating degree:day is the amount of heat required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree below the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One heating degree:day is also the amount of heat required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F below that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour.  Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n Cool D-D-Cooling degree days: One cooling degree:day is the amount of cooling required to keep a structure at 65 degree F when the outside temperature remains one degree above the 65 degree F threshold for 24 hours. One cooling degree:day is also the amount of cooling required to keep that structure at 65 degree F when the temperature remains 24 degree F above that 65 degree  threshold for 1 hour. Note that there are no negative degree-days. If the temperature remains below the threshold, there is no degree-day accumulation.  \n\n In Temp-Inside Temperature: Inside temperature recorded from the console location.  Temperature is sampled every 15 seconds and an average over the archive interval is taken as the data record.  In Hum-Inside Humidity: Humidity of the air measured from inside at the location of the station console.  \n\n In Heat-Inside Heat index: Heat index measured from inside at the location of the station console.  Heat Index uses temperature and relative humidity to determine how hot the air actually 'feels.'

However, when humidity is high (i.e., the air is saturated with water vapor) the apparent temperature 'feels' higher than the actual air temperature, because perspiration evaporates more slowly. Uses formula of Steadman (1998).  \n\n In EMC-Inside Equilibrium moisture content: For any given combination of temperature and relative humidity conditions, this is an equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for a piece of wood.  Calculated from inside temperature and inside humidity values.  \n\n In Air Density-Inside Air Density: The density of the air recorded from inside at the location of the weather station console.  ET-Potential Evapotranspiration: The potential evapotranspiration.  The Vantage calculated ETo takes samples of Temperature, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation over a one Hour period and derives an average value.
