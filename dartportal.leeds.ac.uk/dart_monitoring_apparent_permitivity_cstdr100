Measurements were taken every 60 minutes between May 2011 and June 2013.  The 'as-design' was to install the probes in vertical arrays within the archaeological sequence (AS) and multiple vertical arrays in the surrounding soil matrix (SSM) to detect lateral variations. The 'as-built' deviated to the 'as-design' due to difficulties in installation in the different sediments.

This required the use of two multiplexors which meant that two data files were created for each site (given the suffix A (where all the probes were installed in the archaeology) and N (where all the probes were installed in the 'natural'). The probes in the well draining soils were given the suffix B to refer to installation in 'Both' archaeology and 'natural'. The data were logged locally and collected, downloaded and processed every month. \n\n The aim is to provide a better understanding of when contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix occurs and what causes this contrast in order to optimise geophysical surveys. \n\n The TDR data take the form of voltage as a function of time and represent a waveform, which can be converted into APT. \n\n Once the APT is calculated, these can be converted into soil moisture content using a number of different equations (a summary of these equations is contained within the collection).  Some of the equations require specific technical information on the soils (some of which is collected in the geotechnical analysis stored in the laboratory collection). Research has shown that depending which equation is used, the variation can be up to 50percent. \n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TDR PROBES AND SETTINGS: Window apparent start length: varies (see calibration file).

Friedman S.P (2003) A Review of Advances in Dielectric and Electrical Conductivity Measurement in Soils Using Time Domain Reflectometry, Published in Vadose Zone Journal 2:444 475 using waveforms in air and water (10 of each) to derive probe apparent length and offset.  The TDR100 Time-Domain Reflectometer is the core of the Campbell Scientific time-domain reflectometry system. This system is used to accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation, or user-specific time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. PC-TDR software is used with our TDR100-based systems during system setup and troubleshooting. It is included with the TDR100. The TDR100 (1) generates a short rise time electromagnetic pulse that is applied to a coaxial system that includes a TDR probe for soil water measurements and (2) samples and digitizes the resulting reflection waveform for analysis or storage. The elapsed travel time and pulse reflection amplitude contain information used by the on-board processor to quickly and accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation or user-specific, time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. A 250-point waveform is collected and analyzed in approximately two seconds. Each waveform can have up to 2,048 data points for monitoring long cable lengths used in rock mass deformation or slope stability. Averaging up to 128 readings makes accurate measurements possible in noisy environments. .  \n\n TDR100 Specifications:  \n\n Pulse generator output: 250 mV into 50 ohms.  \n\n Output impedance: 50 ohms +/-1percent.  \n\n Time response of combined pulse generator and sampling circuit: less than 300 picoseconds.  \n\n Pulse generator aberrations: Within first 10 nanoseconds: +/-5percent  After 10 nanoseconds: +/-0.5percent.  \n\n Pulse length: 14 microseconds.  \n\n Timing resolution: 12.2 picoseconds.  \n\n Waveform sampling: 20 to 2048 waveform values over chosen length.  \n\n Distance range: -2-2100m(0-7ms).  \n\n Resolution: 1.8mm (6.1ps). \n\n Waveform averaging: 1 to 128.  \n\n Electrostatic discharge protection: Internal clamping.  \n\n Current drain:  During measurement: 270 mA,  Sleep mode: 20 mA,  Standby mode: 2 mA.  \n\n Power supply: Unregulated 12 V(9.6 V to 16 V), 300 mA maximum.  \n\n Operating Temperature: -40 degree  to +55 degree C.  \n\n \n\n Collected with CR1000 datalogger.  \n\n CR1000 Specifications.  \n\n Maximum Scan Rate: 100 Hz.  \n\n Analog Inputs: 16 single-ended or 8 differential individually configured.  \n\n Pulse Counters: 2.  \n\n Switched Excitation Channels: 3 voltage.  \n\n Digital Ports:  8 I/Os or 4 RS-232 COM.  \n\n Communications/Data Storage Ports:   1 CS I/O, 1 RS-232, 1 parallel peripheral.  \n\n Switched 12 Volt: 1.  \n\n Input Voltage Range: +/-5 Vdc.  \n\n Analog Voltage Accuracy: +/-(0.06percent of reading + offset), 0 degree  to 40 degree C.  \n\n Analog Resolution: 0.33 microV.  \n\n A/D Bits: 13.  \n\n Temperature Range: Standard: -25 degree  to +50 degree C Extended: -55 degree  to +85 degree C.  \n\n Memory: 2 MB Flash (operating system), 4 MB (CPU usage, program storage, and data storage).  \n\n Power Requirements:   9.6 to 16 Vdc.  \n\n Current Drain: 0.7 mA typical; 0.9 mA max.

Industrial-grade cards also function over wider temperature ranges and have longer life spans than consumer-grade cards.  Data stored on the card can be retrieved either by removing the card and carrying it to a computer or through a communications link with the datalogger. The computer can read the CF card either with the computer's PCMCIA slot and the CF1 adapter or the computer's USB port and the 17752 Reader/Writer. \n\n CFM100 Specifications: Typical Access Speed: 200 to 400 kbits s-1.  \n\n Memory Configuration: User selectable; ring (default) or fill-and-stop.  \n\n Power Requirements: 12 V supplied through the datalogger's peripheral port.  \n\n CF Card Requirements: Industrial-grade; storage capacity of 2 GB or less.  \n\n Dimensions: 10.0 x 8.3 x 6.5 cm (4.0\" x 3.3\" x 2.6\").  \n\n Dimensions of CR1000 with CFM100 attached: 25.2 x 10.2 x 7.1 cm  (9.9\" x 4.0\" x 2.8\").  \n\n Weight: 133 g (4.7 oz).  \n\n Typical current drain: RS-232 Port Active Writing to Card: 30 mA Reading Card: 20 mA RS-232 Port Not Active  Writing to Card: 20 mA  Reading Card: 15 mA.

The data were logged locally and collected, downloaded and processed every month. \n\n The aim is to provide a better understanding of when contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix occurs and what causes this contrast in order to optimise geophysical surveys. \n\n The TDR data take the form of voltage as a function of time and represent a waveform, which can be converted into APT. \n\n Once the APT is calculated, these can be converted into soil moisture content using a number of different equations (a summary of these equations is contained within the collection).  Some of the equations require specific technical information on the soils (some of which is collected in the geotechnical analysis stored in the laboratory collection). Research has shown that depending which equation is used, the variation can be up to 50percent. \n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TDR PROBES AND SETTINGS: Window apparent start length: varies (see calibration file).

The TDR100 Time-Domain Reflectometer is the core of the Campbell Scientific time-domain reflectometry system. This system is used to accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation, or user-specific time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. PC-TDR software is used with our TDR100-based systems during system setup and troubleshooting. It is included with the TDR100. The TDR100 (1) generates a short rise time electromagnetic pulse that is applied to a coaxial system that includes a TDR probe for soil water measurements and (2) samples and digitizes the resulting reflection waveform for analysis or storage. The elapsed travel time and pulse reflection amplitude contain information used by the on-board processor to quickly and accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation or user-specific, time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. A 250-point waveform is collected and analyzed in approximately two seconds. Each waveform can have up to 2,048 data points for monitoring long cable lengths used in rock mass deformation or slope stability.

Data are recorded every 60 minutes.", "resource.description": "Apparent Permittivity (APT) data were extracted from the waveform collected by the Time Domain Reflectometry probes installed at each of the DART sites, both inside and outside of archaeological features. Measurements were taken every 60 minutes between May 2011 and June 2013.  The 'as-design' was to install the probes in vertical arrays within the archaeological sequence (AS) and multiple vertical arrays in the surrounding soil matrix (SSM) to detect lateral variations. The 'as-built' deviated to the 'as-design' due to difficulties in installation in the different sediments. The location of each probe can be found on the section drawings in the excavation collection. The exact locations for the probes are as follows: DDCF: \n\n DDPF: \n\n HHQF: \n\n HHCC:\n\n A larger numbers of probes was used in the heavy clay soils as opposed to the free draining soils. This required the use of two multiplexors which meant that two data files were created for each site (given the suffix A (where all the probes were installed in the archaeology) and N (where all the probes were installed in the 'natural'). The probes in the well draining soils were given the suffix B to refer to installation in 'Both' archaeology and 'natural'. The data were logged locally and collected, downloaded and processed every month. \n\n The aim is to provide a better understanding of when contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix occurs and what causes this contrast in order to optimise geophysical surveys. \n\n The TDR data take the form of voltage as a function of time and represent a waveform, which can be converted into APT. \n\n Once the APT is calculated, these can be converted into soil moisture content using a number of different equations (a summary of these equations is contained within the collection).  Some of the equations require specific technical information on the soils (some of which is collected in the geotechnical analysis stored in the laboratory collection). Research has shown that depending which equation is used, the variation can be up to 50percent. \n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TDR PROBES AND SETTINGS: Window apparent start length: varies (see calibration file).

Friedman S.P (2003) A Review of Advances in Dielectric and Electrical Conductivity Measurement in Soils Using Time Domain Reflectometry, Published in Vadose Zone Journal 2:444 475 using waveforms in air and water (10 of each) to derive probe apparent length and offset.  The TDR100 Time-Domain Reflectometer is the core of the Campbell Scientific time-domain reflectometry system. This system is used to accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation, or user-specific time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. PC-TDR software is used with our TDR100-based systems during system setup and troubleshooting. It is included with the TDR100. The TDR100 (1) generates a short rise time electromagnetic pulse that is applied to a coaxial system that includes a TDR probe for soil water measurements and (2) samples and digitizes the resulting reflection waveform for analysis or storage. The elapsed travel time and pulse reflection amplitude contain information used by the on-board processor to quickly and accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation or user-specific, time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. A 250-point waveform is collected and analyzed in approximately two seconds. Each waveform can have up to 2,048 data points for monitoring long cable lengths used in rock mass deformation or slope stability. Averaging up to 128 readings makes accurate measurements possible in noisy environments. .  \n\n TDR100 Specifications:  \n\n Pulse generator output: 250 mV into 50 ohms.  \n\n Output impedance: 50 ohms +/-1percent.  \n\n Time response of combined pulse generator and sampling circuit: less than 300 picoseconds.  \n\n Pulse generator aberrations: Within first 10 nanoseconds: +/-5percent  After 10 nanoseconds: +/-0.5percent.  \n\n Pulse length: 14 microseconds.  \n\n Timing resolution: 12.2 picoseconds.  \n\n Waveform sampling: 20 to 2048 waveform values over chosen length.  \n\n Distance range: -2-2100m(0-7ms).  \n\n Resolution: 1.8mm (6.1ps). \n\n Waveform averaging: 1 to 128.  \n\n Electrostatic discharge protection: Internal clamping.  \n\n Current drain:  During measurement: 270 mA,  Sleep mode: 20 mA,  Standby mode: 2 mA.  \n\n Power supply: Unregulated 12 V(9.6 V to 16 V), 300 mA maximum.  \n\n Operating Temperature: -40 degree  to +55 degree C.  \n\n \n\n Collected with CR1000 datalogger.  \n\n CR1000 Specifications.  \n\n Maximum Scan Rate: 100 Hz.  \n\n Analog Inputs: 16 single-ended or 8 differential individually configured.  \n\n Pulse Counters: 2.  \n\n Switched Excitation Channels: 3 voltage.  \n\n Digital Ports:  8 I/Os or 4 RS-232 COM.  \n\n Communications/Data Storage Ports:   1 CS I/O, 1 RS-232, 1 parallel peripheral.  \n\n Switched 12 Volt: 1.  \n\n Input Voltage Range: +/-5 Vdc.  \n\n Analog Voltage Accuracy: +/-(0.06percent of reading + offset), 0 degree  to 40 degree C.  \n\n Analog Resolution: 0.33 microV.  \n\n A/D Bits: 13.  \n\n Temperature Range: Standard: -25 degree  to +50 degree C Extended: -55 degree  to +85 degree C.  \n\n Memory: 2 MB Flash (operating system), 4 MB (CPU usage, program storage, and data storage).  \n\n Power Requirements:   9.6 to 16 Vdc.  \n\n Current Drain: 0.7 mA typical; 0.9 mA max.

The TDR100 Time-Domain Reflectometer is the core of the Campbell Scientific time-domain reflectometry system. This system is used to accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation, or user-specific time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. PC-TDR software is used with our TDR100-based systems during system setup and troubleshooting.

The TDR100 (1) generates a short rise time electromagnetic pulse that is applied to a coaxial system that includes a TDR probe for soil water measurements and (2) samples and digitizes the resulting reflection waveform for analysis or storage. The elapsed travel time and pulse reflection amplitude contain information used by the on-board processor to quickly and accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation or user-specific, time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. A 250-point waveform is collected and analyzed in approximately two seconds. Each waveform can have up to 2,048 data points for monitoring long cable lengths used in rock mass deformation or slope stability. Averaging up to 128 readings makes accurate measurements possible in noisy environments. .  \n\n TDR100 Specifications:  \n\n Pulse generator output: 250 mV into 50 ohms.  \n\n Output impedance: 50 ohms +/-1percent.  \n\n Time response of combined pulse generator and sampling circuit: less than 300 picoseconds.  \n\n Pulse generator aberrations: Within first 10 nanoseconds: +/-5percent  After 10 nanoseconds: +/-0.5percent.  \n\n Pulse length: 14 microseconds.  \n\n Timing resolution: 12.2 picoseconds.  \n\n Waveform sampling: 20 to 2048 waveform values over chosen length.  \n\n Distance range: -2-2100m(0-7ms).  \n\n Resolution: 1.8mm (6.1ps). \n\n Waveform averaging: 1 to 128.  \n\n Electrostatic discharge protection: Internal clamping.  \n\n Current drain:  During measurement: 270 mA,  Sleep mode: 20 mA,  Standby mode: 2 mA.  \n\n Power supply: Unregulated 12 V(9.6 V to 16 V), 300 mA maximum.  \n\n Operating Temperature: -40 degree  to +55 degree C.  \n\n \n\n Collected with CR1000 datalogger.  \n\n CR1000 Specifications.  \n\n Maximum Scan Rate: 100 Hz.  \n\n Analog Inputs: 16 single-ended or 8 differential individually configured.  \n\n Pulse Counters: 2.  \n\n Switched Excitation Channels: 3 voltage.  \n\n Digital Ports:  8 I/Os or 4 RS-232 COM.  \n\n Communications/Data Storage Ports:   1 CS I/O, 1 RS-232, 1 parallel peripheral.  \n\n Switched 12 Volt: 1.  \n\n Input Voltage Range: +/-5 Vdc.  \n\n Analog Voltage Accuracy: +/-(0.06percent of reading + offset), 0 degree  to 40 degree C.  \n\n Analog Resolution: 0.33 microV.  \n\n A/D Bits: 13.  \n\n Temperature Range: Standard: -25 degree  to +50 degree C Extended: -55 degree  to +85 degree C.  \n\n Memory: 2 MB Flash (operating system), 4 MB (CPU usage, program storage, and data storage).  \n\n Power Requirements:   9.6 to 16 Vdc.  \n\n Current Drain: 0.7 mA typical; 0.9 mA max.

Only industrial-grade CF cards should be used with our products. Although consumer-grade cards cost less than industrial-grade cards, the consumer-grade cards are more susceptible to failure resulting in both the loss of the card and its stored data. Industrial-grade cards also function over wider temperature ranges and have longer life spans than consumer-grade cards.  Data stored on the card can be retrieved either by removing the card and carrying it to a computer or through a communications link with the datalogger. The computer can read the CF card either with the computer's PCMCIA slot and the CF1 adapter or the computer's USB port and the 17752 Reader/Writer. \n\n CFM100 Specifications: Typical Access Speed: 200 to 400 kbits s-1.  \n\n Memory Configuration: User selectable; ring (default) or fill-and-stop.  \n\n Power Requirements: 12 V supplied through the datalogger's peripheral port.  \n\n CF Card Requirements: Industrial-grade; storage capacity of 2 GB or less.  \n\n Dimensions: 10.0 x 8.3 x 6.5 cm (4.0\" x 3.3\" x 2.6\").  \n\n Dimensions of CR1000 with CFM100 attached: 25.2 x 10.2 x 7.1 cm  (9.9\" x 4.0\" x 2.8\").  \n\n Weight: 133 g (4.7 oz).  \n\n Typical current drain: RS-232 Port Active Writing to Card: 30 mA Reading Card: 20 mA RS-232 Port Not Active  Writing to Card: 20 mA  Reading Card: 15 mA.

Measurements were taken every 60 minutes between May 2011 and June 2013.  The 'as-design' was to install the probes in vertical arrays within the archaeological sequence (AS) and multiple vertical arrays in the surrounding soil matrix (SSM) to detect lateral variations. The 'as-built' deviated to the 'as-design' due to difficulties in installation in the different sediments. The location of each probe can be found on the section drawings in the excavation collection. The exact locations for the probes are as follows: DDCF: \n\n DDPF: \n\n HHQF: \n\n HHCC:\n\n A larger numbers of probes was used in the heavy clay soils as opposed to the free draining soils. This required the use of two multiplexors which meant that two data files were created for each site (given the suffix A (where all the probes were installed in the archaeology) and N (where all the probes were installed in the 'natural'). The probes in the well draining soils were given the suffix B to refer to installation in 'Both' archaeology and 'natural'. The data were logged locally and collected, downloaded and processed every month. \n\n The aim is to provide a better understanding of when contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix occurs and what causes this contrast in order to optimise geophysical surveys. \n\n The TDR data take the form of voltage as a function of time and represent a waveform, which can be converted into APT. \n\n Once the APT is calculated, these can be converted into soil moisture content using a number of different equations (a summary of these equations is contained within the collection).  Some of the equations require specific technical information on the soils (some of which is collected in the geotechnical analysis stored in the laboratory collection). Research has shown that depending which equation is used, the variation can be up to 50percent. \n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TDR PROBES AND SETTINGS: Window apparent start length: varies (see calibration file).

The TDR100 Time-Domain Reflectometer is the core of the Campbell Scientific time-domain reflectometry system. This system is used to accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation, or user-specific time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. PC-TDR software is used with our TDR100-based systems during system setup and troubleshooting. It is included with the TDR100. The TDR100 (1) generates a short rise time electromagnetic pulse that is applied to a coaxial system that includes a TDR probe for soil water measurements and (2) samples and digitizes the resulting reflection waveform for analysis or storage. The elapsed travel time and pulse reflection amplitude contain information used by the on-board processor to quickly and accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation or user-specific, time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. A 250-point waveform is collected and analyzed in approximately two seconds.

Data are recorded every 60 minutes.", "resource.description": "Apparent Permittivity (APT) data were extracted from the waveform collected by the Time Domain Reflectometry probes installed at each of the DART sites, both inside and outside of archaeological features. Measurements were taken every 60 minutes between May 2011 and June 2013.  The 'as-design' was to install the probes in vertical arrays within the archaeological sequence (AS) and multiple vertical arrays in the surrounding soil matrix (SSM) to detect lateral variations. The 'as-built' deviated to the 'as-design' due to difficulties in installation in the different sediments. The location of each probe can be found on the section drawings in the excavation collection. The exact locations for the probes are as follows: DDCF: \n\n DDPF: \n\n HHQF: \n\n HHCC:\n\n A larger numbers of probes was used in the heavy clay soils as opposed to the free draining soils. This required the use of two multiplexors which meant that two data files were created for each site (given the suffix A (where all the probes were installed in the archaeology) and N (where all the probes were installed in the 'natural'). The probes in the well draining soils were given the suffix B to refer to installation in 'Both' archaeology and 'natural'. The data were logged locally and collected, downloaded and processed every month. \n\n The aim is to provide a better understanding of when contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix occurs and what causes this contrast in order to optimise geophysical surveys. \n\n The TDR data take the form of voltage as a function of time and represent a waveform, which can be converted into APT. \n\n Once the APT is calculated, these can be converted into soil moisture content using a number of different equations (a summary of these equations is contained within the collection).  Some of the equations require specific technical information on the soils (some of which is collected in the geotechnical analysis stored in the laboratory collection). Research has shown that depending which equation is used, the variation can be up to 50percent. \n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TDR PROBES AND SETTINGS: Window apparent start length: varies (see calibration file).

Friedman S.P (2003) A Review of Advances in Dielectric and Electrical Conductivity Measurement in Soils Using Time Domain Reflectometry, Published in Vadose Zone Journal 2:444 475 using waveforms in air and water (10 of each) to derive probe apparent length and offset.  The TDR100 Time-Domain Reflectometer is the core of the Campbell Scientific time-domain reflectometry system. This system is used to accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation, or user-specific time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. PC-TDR software is used with our TDR100-based systems during system setup and troubleshooting. It is included with the TDR100. The TDR100 (1) generates a short rise time electromagnetic pulse that is applied to a coaxial system that includes a TDR probe for soil water measurements and (2) samples and digitizes the resulting reflection waveform for analysis or storage. The elapsed travel time and pulse reflection amplitude contain information used by the on-board processor to quickly and accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation or user-specific, time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. A 250-point waveform is collected and analyzed in approximately two seconds. Each waveform can have up to 2,048 data points for monitoring long cable lengths used in rock mass deformation or slope stability. Averaging up to 128 readings makes accurate measurements possible in noisy environments. .  \n\n TDR100 Specifications:  \n\n Pulse generator output: 250 mV into 50 ohms.  \n\n Output impedance: 50 ohms +/-1percent.  \n\n Time response of combined pulse generator and sampling circuit: less than 300 picoseconds.  \n\n Pulse generator aberrations: Within first 10 nanoseconds: +/-5percent  After 10 nanoseconds: +/-0.5percent.  \n\n Pulse length: 14 microseconds.  \n\n Timing resolution: 12.2 picoseconds.  \n\n Waveform sampling: 20 to 2048 waveform values over chosen length.  \n\n Distance range: -2-2100m(0-7ms).  \n\n Resolution: 1.8mm (6.1ps). \n\n Waveform averaging: 1 to 128.  \n\n Electrostatic discharge protection: Internal clamping.  \n\n Current drain:  During measurement: 270 mA,  Sleep mode: 20 mA,  Standby mode: 2 mA.  \n\n Power supply: Unregulated 12 V(9.6 V to 16 V), 300 mA maximum.  \n\n Operating Temperature: -40 degree  to +55 degree C.  \n\n \n\n Collected with CR1000 datalogger.  \n\n CR1000 Specifications.  \n\n Maximum Scan Rate: 100 Hz.  \n\n Analog Inputs: 16 single-ended or 8 differential individually configured.  \n\n Pulse Counters: 2.  \n\n Switched Excitation Channels: 3 voltage.  \n\n Digital Ports:  8 I/Os or 4 RS-232 COM.  \n\n Communications/Data Storage Ports:   1 CS I/O, 1 RS-232, 1 parallel peripheral.  \n\n Switched 12 Volt: 1.  \n\n Input Voltage Range: +/-5 Vdc.  \n\n Analog Voltage Accuracy: +/-(0.06percent of reading + offset), 0 degree  to 40 degree C.  \n\n Analog Resolution: 0.33 microV.  \n\n A/D Bits: 13.  \n\n Temperature Range: Standard: -25 degree  to +50 degree C Extended: -55 degree  to +85 degree C.  \n\n Memory: 2 MB Flash (operating system), 4 MB (CPU usage, program storage, and data storage).  \n\n Power Requirements:   9.6 to 16 Vdc.  \n\n Current Drain: 0.7 mA typical; 0.9 mA max.

Measurements were taken every 60 minutes between May 2011 and June 2013.  The 'as-design' was to install the probes in vertical arrays within the archaeological sequence (AS) and multiple vertical arrays in the surrounding soil matrix (SSM) to detect lateral variations. The 'as-built' deviated to the 'as-design' due to difficulties in installation in the different sediments. The location of each probe can be found on the section drawings in the excavation collection. The exact locations for the probes are as follows: DDCF: \n\n DDPF: \n\n HHQF: \n\n HHCC:\n\n A larger numbers of probes was used in the heavy clay soils as opposed to the free draining soils. This required the use of two multiplexors which meant that two data files were created for each site (given the suffix A (where all the probes were installed in the archaeology) and N (where all the probes were installed in the 'natural'). The probes in the well draining soils were given the suffix B to refer to installation in 'Both' archaeology and 'natural'. The data were logged locally and collected, downloaded and processed every month. \n\n The aim is to provide a better understanding of when contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix occurs and what causes this contrast in order to optimise geophysical surveys. \n\n The TDR data take the form of voltage as a function of time and represent a waveform, which can be converted into APT. \n\n Once the APT is calculated, these can be converted into soil moisture content using a number of different equations (a summary of these equations is contained within the collection).  Some of the equations require specific technical information on the soils (some of which is collected in the geotechnical analysis stored in the laboratory collection). Research has shown that depending which equation is used, the variation can be up to 50percent. \n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TDR PROBES AND SETTINGS: Window apparent start length: varies (see calibration file).

The TDR100 Time-Domain Reflectometer is the core of the Campbell Scientific time-domain reflectometry system. This system is used to accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation, or user-specific time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. PC-TDR software is used with our TDR100-based systems during system setup and troubleshooting. It is included with the TDR100. The TDR100 (1) generates a short rise time electromagnetic pulse that is applied to a coaxial system that includes a TDR probe for soil water measurements and (2) samples and digitizes the resulting reflection waveform for analysis or storage. The elapsed travel time and pulse reflection amplitude contain information used by the on-board processor to quickly and accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation or user-specific, time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. A 250-point waveform is collected and analyzed in approximately two seconds.

Data are recorded every 60 minutes.", "resource.description": "Apparent Permittivity (APT) data were extracted from the waveform collected by the Time Domain Reflectometry probes installed at each of the DART sites, both inside and outside of archaeological features. Measurements were taken every 60 minutes between May 2011 and June 2013.  The 'as-design' was to install the probes in vertical arrays within the archaeological sequence (AS) and multiple vertical arrays in the surrounding soil matrix (SSM) to detect lateral variations. The 'as-built' deviated to the 'as-design' due to difficulties in installation in the different sediments. The location of each probe can be found on the section drawings in the excavation collection. The exact locations for the probes are as follows: DDCF: \n\n DDPF: \n\n HHQF: \n\n HHCC:\n\n A larger numbers of probes was used in the heavy clay soils as opposed to the free draining soils. This required the use of two multiplexors which meant that two data files were created for each site (given the suffix A (where all the probes were installed in the archaeology) and N (where all the probes were installed in the 'natural'). The probes in the well draining soils were given the suffix B to refer to installation in 'Both' archaeology and 'natural'. The data were logged locally and collected, downloaded and processed every month. \n\n The aim is to provide a better understanding of when contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix occurs and what causes this contrast in order to optimise geophysical surveys. \n\n The TDR data take the form of voltage as a function of time and represent a waveform, which can be converted into APT. \n\n Once the APT is calculated, these can be converted into soil moisture content using a number of different equations (a summary of these equations is contained within the collection).  Some of the equations require specific technical information on the soils (some of which is collected in the geotechnical analysis stored in the laboratory collection). Research has shown that depending which equation is used, the variation can be up to 50percent. \n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TDR PROBES AND SETTINGS: Window apparent start length: varies (see calibration file).

The TDR100 Time-Domain Reflectometer is the core of the Campbell Scientific time-domain reflectometry system. This system is used to accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation, or user-specific time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. PC-TDR software is used with our TDR100-based systems during system setup and troubleshooting. It is included with the TDR100. The TDR100 (1) generates a short rise time electromagnetic pulse that is applied to a coaxial system that includes a TDR probe for soil water measurements and (2) samples and digitizes the resulting reflection waveform for analysis or storage. The elapsed travel time and pulse reflection amplitude contain information used by the on-board processor to quickly and accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation or user-specific, time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. A 250-point waveform is collected and analyzed in approximately two seconds. Each waveform can have up to 2,048 data points for monitoring long cable lengths used in rock mass deformation or slope stability. Averaging up to 128 readings makes accurate measurements possible in noisy environments. .  \n\n TDR100 Specifications:  \n\n Pulse generator output: 250 mV into 50 ohms.  \n\n Output impedance: 50 ohms +/-1percent.  \n\n Time response of combined pulse generator and sampling circuit: less than 300 picoseconds.  \n\n Pulse generator aberrations: Within first 10 nanoseconds: +/-5percent  After 10 nanoseconds: +/-0.5percent.  \n\n Pulse length: 14 microseconds.  \n\n Timing resolution: 12.2 picoseconds.  \n\n Waveform sampling: 20 to 2048 waveform values over chosen length.  \n\n Distance range: -2-2100m(0-7ms).  \n\n Resolution: 1.8mm (6.1ps). \n\n Waveform averaging: 1 to 128.  \n\n Electrostatic discharge protection: Internal clamping.  \n\n Current drain:  During measurement: 270 mA,  Sleep mode: 20 mA,  Standby mode: 2 mA.  \n\n Power supply: Unregulated 12 V(9.6 V to 16 V), 300 mA maximum.  \n\n Operating Temperature: -40 degree  to +55 degree C.  \n\n \n\n Collected with CR1000 datalogger.  \n\n CR1000 Specifications.  \n\n Maximum Scan Rate: 100 Hz.  \n\n Analog Inputs: 16 single-ended or 8 differential individually configured.  \n\n Pulse Counters: 2.  \n\n Switched Excitation Channels: 3 voltage.  \n\n Digital Ports:  8 I/Os or 4 RS-232 COM.  \n\n Communications/Data Storage Ports:   1 CS I/O, 1 RS-232, 1 parallel peripheral.  \n\n Switched 12 Volt: 1.  \n\n Input Voltage Range: +/-5 Vdc.  \n\n Analog Voltage Accuracy: +/-(0.06percent of reading + offset), 0 degree  to 40 degree C.  \n\n Analog Resolution: 0.33 microV.  \n\n A/D Bits: 13.  \n\n Temperature Range: Standard: -25 degree  to +50 degree C Extended: -55 degree  to +85 degree C.  \n\n Memory: 2 MB Flash (operating system), 4 MB (CPU usage, program storage, and data storage).  \n\n Power Requirements:   9.6 to 16 Vdc.  \n\n Current Drain: 0.7 mA typical; 0.9 mA max.

The 'as-design' was to install the probes in vertical arrays within the archaeological sequence (AS) and multiple vertical arrays in the surrounding soil matrix (SSM) to detect lateral variations. The 'as-built' deviated to the 'as-design' due to difficulties in installation in the different sediments.

The exact locations for the probes are as follows: DDCF: \n\n DDPF: \n\n HHQF: \n\n HHCC:\n\n A larger numbers of probes was used in the heavy clay soils as opposed to the free draining soils. This required the use of two multiplexors which meant that two data files were created for each site (given the suffix A (where all the probes were installed in the archaeology) and N (where all the probes were installed in the 'natural'). The probes in the well draining soils were given the suffix B to refer to installation in 'Both' archaeology and 'natural'. The data were logged locally and collected, downloaded and processed every month. \n\n The aim is to provide a better understanding of when contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix occurs and what causes this contrast in order to optimise geophysical surveys. \n\n The TDR data take the form of voltage as a function of time and represent a waveform, which can be converted into APT. \n\n Once the APT is calculated, these can be converted into soil moisture content using a number of different equations (a summary of these equations is contained within the collection).  Some of the equations require specific technical information on the soils (some of which is collected in the geotechnical analysis stored in the laboratory collection). Research has shown that depending which equation is used, the variation can be up to 50percent. \n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TDR PROBES AND SETTINGS: Window apparent start length: varies (see calibration file).

The TDR100 Time-Domain Reflectometer is the core of the Campbell Scientific time-domain reflectometry system. This system is used to accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation, or user-specific time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. PC-TDR software is used with our TDR100-based systems during system setup and troubleshooting. It is included with the TDR100. The TDR100 (1) generates a short rise time electromagnetic pulse that is applied to a coaxial system that includes a TDR probe for soil water measurements and (2) samples and digitizes the resulting reflection waveform for analysis or storage. The elapsed travel time and pulse reflection amplitude contain information used by the on-board processor to quickly and accurately determine soil volumetric water content, soil bulk electrical conductivity, rock mass deformation or user-specific, time-domain measurement. Up to 16 TDR100s can be controlled using a single Campbell Scientific datalogger. A 250-point waveform is collected and analyzed in approximately two seconds. Each waveform can have up to 2,048 data points for monitoring long cable lengths used in rock mass deformation or slope stability. Averaging up to 128 readings makes accurate measurements possible in noisy environments. .  \n\n TDR100 Specifications:  \n\n Pulse generator output: 250 mV into 50 ohms.  \n\n Output impedance: 50 ohms +/-1percent.  \n\n Time response of combined pulse generator and sampling circuit: less than 300 picoseconds.  \n\n Pulse generator aberrations: Within first 10 nanoseconds: +/-5percent  After 10 nanoseconds: +/-0.5percent.  \n\n Pulse length: 14 microseconds.  \n\n Timing resolution: 12.2 picoseconds.  \n\n Waveform sampling: 20 to 2048 waveform values over chosen length.  \n\n Distance range: -2-2100m(0-7ms).  \n\n Resolution: 1.8mm (6.1ps). \n\n Waveform averaging: 1 to 128.  \n\n Electrostatic discharge protection: Internal clamping.  \n\n Current drain:  During measurement: 270 mA,  Sleep mode: 20 mA,  Standby mode: 2 mA.  \n\n Power supply: Unregulated 12 V(9.6 V to 16 V), 300 mA maximum.  \n\n Operating Temperature: -40 degree  to +55 degree C.  \n\n \n\n Collected with CR1000 datalogger.  \n\n CR1000 Specifications.  \n\n Maximum Scan Rate: 100 Hz.  \n\n Analog Inputs: 16 single-ended or 8 differential individually configured.  \n\n Pulse Counters: 2.  \n\n Switched Excitation Channels: 3 voltage.  \n\n Digital Ports:  8 I/Os or 4 RS-232 COM.  \n\n Communications/Data Storage Ports:   1 CS I/O, 1 RS-232, 1 parallel peripheral.  \n\n Switched 12 Volt: 1.  \n\n Input Voltage Range: +/-5 Vdc.  \n\n Analog Voltage Accuracy: +/-(0.06percent of reading + offset), 0 degree  to 40 degree C.  \n\n Analog Resolution: 0.33 microV.  \n\n A/D Bits: 13.  \n\n Temperature Range: Standard: -25 degree  to +50 degree C Extended: -55 degree  to +85 degree C.  \n\n Memory: 2 MB Flash (operating system), 4 MB (CPU usage, program storage, and data storage).  \n\n Power Requirements:   9.6 to 16 Vdc.  \n\n Current Drain: 0.7 mA typical; 0.9 mA max.

The module connects to the 40-pin peripheral port on a CR1000 or CR3000 datalogger.  \n\n Technical Description: The CFM100 includes a card slot that can fit one Type I or Type II CF card. Only industrial-grade CF cards should be used with our products. Although consumer-grade cards cost less than industrial-grade cards, the consumer-grade cards are more susceptible to failure resulting in both the loss of the card and its stored data. Industrial-grade cards also function over wider temperature ranges and have longer life spans than consumer-grade cards.  Data stored on the card can be retrieved either by removing the card and carrying it to a computer or through a communications link with the datalogger. The computer can read the CF card either with the computer's PCMCIA slot and the CF1 adapter or the computer's USB port and the 17752 Reader/Writer. \n\n CFM100 Specifications: Typical Access Speed: 200 to 400 kbits s-1.  \n\n Memory Configuration: User selectable; ring (default) or fill-and-stop.  \n\n Power Requirements: 12 V supplied through the datalogger's peripheral port.  \n\n CF Card Requirements: Industrial-grade; storage capacity of 2 GB or less.  \n\n Dimensions: 10.0 x 8.3 x 6.5 cm (4.0\" x 3.3\" x 2.6\").  \n\n Dimensions of CR1000 with CFM100 attached: 25.2 x 10.2 x 7.1 cm  (9.9\" x 4.0\" x 2.8\").  \n\n Weight: 133 g (4.7 oz).  \n\n Typical current drain: RS-232 Port Active Writing to Card: 30 mA Reading Card: 20 mA RS-232 Port Not Active  Writing to Card: 20 mA  Reading Card: 15 mA.
