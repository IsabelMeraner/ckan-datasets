Only industrial-grade CF cards should be used with our products. Although consumer-grade cards cost less than industrial-grade cards, the consumer-grade cards are more susceptible to failure resulting in both the loss of the card and its stored data. Industrial-grade cards also function over wider temperature ranges and have longer life spans than consumer-grade cards.  Data stored on the card can be retrieved either by removing the card and carrying it to a computer or through a communications link with the datalogger. The computer can read the CF card either with the computer's PCMCIA slot and the CF1 adapter or the computer's USB port and the 17752 Reader/Writer.  \n\n\n\nCFM100 Specifications: \n\nTypical Access Speed: 200 to 400 kbits s-1.\n\n  Memory Configuration: User selectable; ring (default) or fill-and-stop.\n\n  Power Requirements: 12 V supplied through the datalogger's peripheral port.\n\n  CF Card Requirements: Industrial-grade; storage capacity of 2 GB or less.\n\n  Dimensions: 10.0 x 8.3 x 6.5 cm (4.0\" x 3.3\" x 2.6\").\n\n  Dimensions of CR1000 with CFM100 attached: 25.2 x 10.2 x 7.1 cm  (9.9\" x 4.0\" x 2.8\").\n\n  Weight: 133 g (4.7 oz).\n\n  Typical current drain: RS-232 Port Active Writing to Card: 30 mA Reading Card: 20 mA RS-232 Port Not Active  Writing to Card: 20 mA  Reading Card: 15 mA.

It easily interfaces with most Campbell Scientific dataloggers and can be used in a variety of applications.  The 107 consists of a thermistor encapsulated in an epoxy-filled aluminum housing. The housing protects the thermistor allowing the probe to be buried in soil or submerged in water.  The 107 is suitable for shallow burial only. Placement of the cable inside a rugged conduit may be advisable for long cable runs especially in locations subject to digging, mowing, traffic, use of power tools, or lightning strikes.\n\n\n\n  Campbell Scientific 107-L thermal probe technical information.\n\n  Sensor: BetaTherm 100K6A1B Thermistor.\n\n  Tolerance: +/-0.2 degree C over 0 degree  to 50 degree C range.\n\n  Temperature Measurement Range: -35 degree  to +50 degree C.\n\n  Steinhart-Hart Equation Error (CRBasic dataloggers only):less than +/-0.01 degree C over measurement range.\n\n  Time Constant in Air: 30 to 60 s in a wind speed of 5 m s-1.\n\n  Maximum  Submersion Depth: 15.24 m (50 ft).

It easily interfaces with most Campbell Scientific dataloggers and can be used in a variety of applications.  The 107 consists of a thermistor encapsulated in an epoxy-filled aluminum housing. The housing protects the thermistor allowing the probe to be buried in soil or submerged in water.  The 107 is suitable for shallow burial only.

The CFM100/CF card combination can be used to expand the datalogger's memory, transport data/programs from the field site(s) to the office, and upload power up functions. The module connects to the 40-pin peripheral port on a CR1000 or CR3000 datalogger.\n\n\n\n  Technical Description: The CFM100 includes a card slot that can fit one Type I or Type II CF card. Only industrial-grade CF cards should be used with our products. Although consumer-grade cards cost less than industrial-grade cards, the consumer-grade cards are more susceptible to failure resulting in both the loss of the card and its stored data. Industrial-grade cards also function over wider temperature ranges and have longer life spans than consumer-grade cards.  Data stored on the card can be retrieved either by removing the card and carrying it to a computer or through a communications link with the datalogger. The computer can read the CF card either with the computer's PCMCIA slot and the CF1 adapter or the computer's USB port and the 17752 Reader/Writer.  \n\n\n\nCFM100 Specifications: \n\nTypical Access Speed: 200 to 400 kbits s-1.\n\n  Memory Configuration: User selectable; ring (default) or fill-and-stop.\n\n  Power Requirements: 12 V supplied through the datalogger's peripheral port.\n\n  CF Card Requirements: Industrial-grade; storage capacity of 2 GB or less.\n\n  Dimensions: 10.0 x 8.3 x 6.5 cm (4.0\" x 3.3\" x 2.6\").\n\n  Dimensions of CR1000 with CFM100 attached: 25.2 x 10.2 x 7.1 cm  (9.9\" x 4.0\" x 2.8\").\n\n  Weight: 133 g (4.7 oz).\n\n  Typical current drain: RS-232 Port Active Writing to Card: 30 mA Reading Card: 20 mA RS-232 Port Not Active  Writing to Card: 20 mA  Reading Card: 15 mA.

The probes were installed between May and August 2011. Readings were taken until the boxes either flooded (Autumn 2012   HHQF, HHCC, DDCF) or were removed from the ground (June 2013). The temperature probes were placed, wherever possible, alongside the TDR probes. The location of each probe can be found on the section drawings in the excavation collection. The large number of probes in the 'heavy' soils required the use of two multiplexors which meant that two data files were created for each site (given the suffix A (where all the probes were installed in the archaeology) and N (where all the probes were installed in the 'natural'). The probes in the well draining soils were given the suffix B to refer to installation in 'Both' archaeology and 'natural'. \n\n The exact locations for the probes are as follows: DDCF: \n\n DDPF: \n\n HHQF: \n\n HHCC:  \n\n The probes measure resistive change and convert this into temperature using the Steinhart and Hart equation \n\n The aim is to provide a better understanding of when contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix occurs and what causes this contrast in order to optimise geophysical surveys. \n\n\n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TEMPERATURE PROBES AND SETTINGS\n\n  Soil temperature data at different depths was measured using Campbell Scientific 107-L thermal probes with 5m of cable in half bridge circuit.

It easily interfaces with most Campbell Scientific dataloggers and can be used in a variety of applications.  The 107 consists of a thermistor encapsulated in an epoxy-filled aluminum housing. The housing protects the thermistor allowing the probe to be buried in soil or submerged in water.  The 107 is suitable for shallow burial only.

The probes were installed between May and August 2011. Readings were taken until the boxes either flooded (Autumn 2012   HHQF, HHCC, DDCF) or were removed from the ground (June 2013). The temperature probes were placed, wherever possible, alongside the TDR probes. The location of each probe can be found on the section drawings in the excavation collection. The large number of probes in the 'heavy' soils required the use of two multiplexors which meant that two data files were created for each site (given the suffix A (where all the probes were installed in the archaeology) and N (where all the probes were installed in the 'natural'). The probes in the well draining soils were given the suffix B to refer to installation in 'Both' archaeology and 'natural'. \n\n The exact locations for the probes are as follows: DDCF: \n\n DDPF: \n\n HHQF: \n\n HHCC:  \n\n The probes measure resistive change and convert this into temperature using the Steinhart and Hart equation \n\n The aim is to provide a better understanding of when contrast between archaeological features and the surrounding soil matrix occurs and what causes this contrast in order to optimise geophysical surveys. \n\n\n\n SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TEMPERATURE PROBES AND SETTINGS\n\n  Soil temperature data at different depths was measured using Campbell Scientific 107-L thermal probes with 5m of cable in half bridge circuit.  The 107 is a rugged, accurate probe that measures temperature of air, soil, or water from -35 degree  to +50 degree C. It easily interfaces with most Campbell Scientific dataloggers and can be used in a variety of applications.  The 107 consists of a thermistor encapsulated in an epoxy-filled aluminum housing. The housing protects the thermistor allowing the probe to be buried in soil or submerged in water.  The 107 is suitable for shallow burial only. Placement of the cable inside a rugged conduit may be advisable for long cable runs especially in locations subject to digging, mowing, traffic, use of power tools, or lightning strikes.\n\n\n\n  Campbell Scientific 107-L thermal probe technical information.\n\n  Sensor: BetaTherm 100K6A1B Thermistor.\n\n  Tolerance: +/-0.2 degree C over 0 degree  to 50 degree C range.\n\n  Temperature Measurement Range: -35 degree  to +50 degree C.\n\n  Steinhart-Hart Equation Error (CRBasic dataloggers only):less than +/-0.01 degree C over measurement range.\n\n  Time Constant in Air: 30 to 60 s in a wind speed of 5 m s-1.\n\n  Maximum  Submersion Depth: 15.24 m (50 ft).

The CFM100/CF card combination can be used to expand the datalogger's memory, transport data/programs from the field site(s) to the office, and upload power up functions. The module connects to the 40-pin peripheral port on a CR1000 or CR3000 datalogger.\n\n\n\n  Technical Description: The CFM100 includes a card slot that can fit one Type I or Type II CF card. Only industrial-grade CF cards should be used with our products. Although consumer-grade cards cost less than industrial-grade cards, the consumer-grade cards are more susceptible to failure resulting in both the loss of the card and its stored data. Industrial-grade cards also function over wider temperature ranges and have longer life spans than consumer-grade cards.  Data stored on the card can be retrieved either by removing the card and carrying it to a computer or through a communications link with the datalogger. The computer can read the CF card either with the computer's PCMCIA slot and the CF1 adapter or the computer's USB port and the 17752 Reader/Writer.  \n\n\n\nCFM100 Specifications: \n\nTypical Access Speed: 200 to 400 kbits s-1.\n\n  Memory Configuration: User selectable; ring (default) or fill-and-stop.\n\n  Power Requirements: 12 V supplied through the datalogger's peripheral port.\n\n  CF Card Requirements: Industrial-grade; storage capacity of 2 GB or less.\n\n  Dimensions: 10.0 x 8.3 x 6.5 cm (4.0\" x 3.3\" x 2.6\").\n\n  Dimensions of CR1000 with CFM100 attached: 25.2 x 10.2 x 7.1 cm  (9.9\" x 4.0\" x 2.8\").\n\n  Weight: 133 g (4.7 oz).\n\n  Typical current drain: RS-232 Port Active Writing to Card: 30 mA Reading Card: 20 mA RS-232 Port Not Active  Writing to Card: 20 mA  Reading Card: 15 mA.
