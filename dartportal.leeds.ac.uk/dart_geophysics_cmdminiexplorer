The survey was conducted using a GF Instruments CMD MiniExplorer at both Horizontal Coplanar (HCP) and Vertical Coplanar (VCP) configurations.  Surveys at each of these configurations yields data from 3 different depths, based on manufacturer sensitivity plots.  For the HCP configuration depths of 0.5m, 1m and 1.8m are possible.  At a VCP configuration, depths of 0.25m, 0.5m and 0.9m are possible.  The survey was undertaken using a traverse interval of 0.5m over a 10m grid. Measurement intervals were controlled under a timed collection system every 0.2 seconds.  Markers were logged every 1m along the traverse to ensure accuracy of measurements.  The survey is part of a monthly collection programme of data collection over 2011-2012.   \n\n EMI Meter: GF Instruments CMD Mini Explorer: These instruments measure the in-phase and quadrature signal produced by induction of an electromagnetic field into the earth.  The in-phase and quadrature response can be equated to apparent magnetic susceptibility and apparent conductivity of the earth.  This can therefore be a useful technique in discriminating both magnetic and resistivity values in a single survey.  The application of this instrument for archaeological applications is presented in:\n\n  Bonsall, J., Fry, R., Gaffney, C., Armit, I., Beck, A., Gaffney, V. Forthcoming (2013).  Assessment of Multi-Depth Prospection Capabilities using a new Low Frequency Electromagnetic Device.  Archaeological Prospection. \n\n Further information from the manufacturer on the instrument can be found at http://www.gfinstruments.cz/index.php?menu=gi&smenu=iem&cont=cmd_&ear=ov \n\n All of the data are stored on an integrated data logger for subsequent post-processing and analysis. The instrument is connected to a computer via a USB cable and downloaded as text files.  The surveys consist of 10m x 10m grids, and for this survey, measurements from the sensor/probes were logged at timed intervals of 0.2 seconds along traverses spaced 0.5m apart.   \n\n Filenames are arranged first by project (DART), then by instrument (CMDMiniExplorer), then by field (one of HHCC, HHQF, DDPF, DDCF), then by date (YYYYMMDD), then by stage (RAW or PRO), then by sensor configuration (HCP or VCP), then by type of data collected (I = In-phase, Q = Quadrature data), then by depth level (A - C from shallowest to deepest levels - depths dependant on HCP or VCP configuration). \n\n

The survey was conducted using a GF Instruments CMD MiniExplorer at both Horizontal Coplanar (HCP) and Vertical Coplanar (VCP) configurations.  Surveys at each of these configurations yields data from 3 different depths, based on manufacturer sensitivity plots.  For the HCP configuration depths of 0.5m, 1m and 1.8m are possible.  At a VCP configuration, depths of 0.25m, 0.5m and 0.9m are possible.  The survey was undertaken using a traverse interval of 0.5m over a 10m grid. Measurement intervals were controlled under a timed collection system every 0.2 seconds.  Markers were logged every 1m along the traverse to ensure accuracy of measurements.  The survey is part of a monthly collection programme of data collection over 2011-2012.   \n\n EMI Meter: GF Instruments CMD Mini Explorer: These instruments measure the in-phase and quadrature signal produced by induction of an electromagnetic field into the earth.  The in-phase and quadrature response can be equated to apparent magnetic susceptibility and apparent conductivity of the earth.  This can therefore be a useful technique in discriminating both magnetic and resistivity values in a single survey.  The application of this instrument for archaeological applications is presented in:\n\n  Bonsall, J., Fry, R., Gaffney, C., Armit, I., Beck, A., Gaffney, V. Forthcoming (2013).

Archaeological Prospection. \n\n Further information from the manufacturer on the instrument can be found at http://www.gfinstruments.cz/index.php?menu=gi&smenu=iem&cont=cmd_&ear=ov \n\n All of the data are stored on an integrated data logger for subsequent post-processing and analysis. The instrument is connected to a computer via a USB cable and downloaded as text files.  The surveys consist of 10m x 10m grids, and for this survey, measurements from the sensor/probes were logged at timed intervals of 0.2 seconds along traverses spaced 0.5m apart.   \n\n Filenames are arranged first by project (DART), then by instrument (CMDMiniExplorer), then by field (one of HHCC, HHQF, DDPF, DDCF), then by date (YYYYMMDD), then by stage (RAW or PRO), then by sensor configuration (HCP or VCP), then by type of data collected (I = In-phase, Q = Quadrature data), then by depth level (A - C from shallowest to deepest levels - depths dependant on HCP or VCP configuration). \n\n Electromagnetic Induction data, X,Y,M values (M values indicating measurements of either In-phase (ppt) or quadrature response (mS/m) RAW = unprocessed (straight from sensor data).", "__extras": {"revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5", "package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488"}}, {"key": "resource.distribution.technique", "value": "Download only", "__extras": {"revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5", "package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488"}}, {"key": "resource.edition", "value": "1", "__extras": {"revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5", "package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488"}}, {"key": "resource.fileFormat", "value": ".csv, .zip", "__extras": {"revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5", "package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488"}}, {"key": "resource.funder", "value": "Science and Heritage Programme, Arts and Humanities Research Council, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council", "__extras": {"package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488", "revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5"}}, {"key": "resource.instructionalMethod", "value": "None - this is a collection", "__extras": {"revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5", "package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488"}}, {"key": "resource.keywords", "value": "Geophysics, Archaeology, Monitoring, EMI, Quadtrature, In phase, Remote Sensing, Mini Explorer", "__extras": {"package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488", "revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5"}}, {"key": "resource.language", "value": "eng", "__extras": {"revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5", "package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488"}}, {"key": "resource.license", "value": "odc-by", "__extras": {"revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5", "package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488"}}, {"key": "resource.license.typeURL", "value": "http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/", "__extras": {"package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488", "revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5"}}, {"key": "resource.lineage", "value": "None: this is raw data", "__extras": {"package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488", "revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5"}}, {"key": "resource.localURI", "value": "http://dartportal.leeds.ac.uk/storage/f/dart_geophysics_cmdminiexplorer", "__extras": {"revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5", "package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488"}}, {"key": "resource.metadata.creator.email", "value": "r.j.fry@student.bradford.ac.uk", "__extras": {"package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488", "revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5"}}, {"key": "resource.metadata.creator.name", "value": "Robert Fry", "__extras": {"package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488", "revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5"}}, {"key": "resource.metadata.creator.orcID", "value": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9711-1131", "__extras": {"revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5", "package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488"}}, {"key": "resource.metadata.language", "value": "eng", "__extras": {"revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5", "package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488"}}, {"key": "resource.processingStage", "value": "Complete", "__extras": {"package_id": "fab5c474-8705-4e23-bad5-f76a17ee2488", "revision_id": "fe702a69-a216-4501-b82f-bf2fecbc6fb5"}}, {"key": "resource.processingSteps", "value": "The EMI data collected was first separated into datasets relating to depth, and then interpolated via a natural neighbour transformation in Golden Software's Surfer program where the data could be sampled at 0.5m x 0.5m intervals, matching the earth resistance resolution.
