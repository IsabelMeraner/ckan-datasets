These are supplied broken up into three seperate datasets. _RAW idicates level 1b sensor data along with view vector and dem files that enable the raw data to be georeferenced. _PRO is the processed data as supplied by NERC ARSF. These data are mapped to OSGB 1936 as ENVI *.BIL files. _DOC is the accompanying documentation supplied by NERC for each flight. \n\n The AISA Eagle is a 12 bit, pushbroom, hyperspectral sensor with a 1000 pixel swath width, covering the visible and near infra-red spectrum 400 - 970nm. The maximum spectral resolution of the sensor is 2.9nm. Also output to the Eagle are data from the fibre optic downwelling irradiance sensor (FODIS). Full details of the sensor can be downloaded from Specim's website. The AISA Eagle requires good atmospheric conditions for the collection of narrow spectral wavebands. In the UK we are yet to collect data better that 2.5nm bandwidth (spectrally binning by 2). In less than perfect illumination or atmospheric conditions the instrument may require spectral and/or spatial binning to allow data to be collected. Should perfect optical conditions be essential for your project then there can be no guarantee that these conditions may coincide with the availability of the aircraft in a single flying season. If this project depends on its support in the flying season immediately following the year of submission (or if spectral quality is less of a concern) then additional guidance concerning spatial and spectral binning should be sought. \n\n The AISA Hawk is a 14 bit sensor able to capture short wave infrared wavelengths, 970 - 2450nm. This makes the Hawk an ideal tool for data acquisition on spectral signatures characteristic to chemical compounds and man-made targets that can not be distinguished using the Eagle instrument. The Hawk has 320 spatial pixels, 244 spectral pixels and a maximum spectral resolution of 8nm.

These are supplied broken up into three seperate datasets. _RAW idicates level 1b sensor data along with view vector and dem files that enable the raw data to be georeferenced. _PRO is the processed data as supplied by NERC ARSF. These data are mapped to OSGB 1936 as ENVI *.BIL files. _DOC is the accompanying documentation supplied by NERC for each flight. This is the raw data. \n\n The AISA Eagle is a 12 bit, pushbroom, hyperspectral sensor with a 1000 pixel swath width, covering the visible and near infra-red spectrum 400 - 970nm. The maximum spectral resolution of the sensor is 2.9nm. Also output to the Eagle are data from the fibre optic downwelling irradiance sensor (FODIS). Full details of the sensor can be downloaded from Specim's website. The AISA Eagle requires good atmospheric conditions for the collection of narrow spectral wavebands. In the UK we are yet to collect data better that 2.5nm bandwidth (spectrally binning by 2). In less than perfect illumination or atmospheric conditions the instrument may require spectral and/or spatial binning to allow data to be collected. Should perfect optical conditions be essential for your project then there can be no guarantee that these conditions may coincide with the availability of the aircraft in a single flying season. If this project depends on its support in the flying season immediately following the year of submission (or if spectral quality is less of a concern) then additional guidance concerning spatial and spectral binning should be sought. \n\n The AISA Hawk is a 14 bit sensor able to capture short wave infrared wavelengths, 970 - 2450nm. This makes the Hawk an ideal tool for data acquisition on spectral signatures characteristic to chemical compounds and man-made targets that can not be distinguished using the Eagle instrument. The Hawk has 320 spatial pixels, 244 spectral pixels and a maximum spectral resolution of 8nm. Full details of the sensor can be downloaded from Specim's website. \n\n This dataset contains \n\n /dem \n\n An ASTER DEM of the area fo georeferencing the data \n\n /fodis \n\n data from the fodis sensor used for atmospheric correction in *.bil format \n\n /level1b\n\n the raw, un georeferenced imagery from the fligthline and masks of bad pixels in *.bil format for both eagle and hawk.\n\n /line_information\n\n XML metadata for each flightline\n\n /navigation\n\n navigation information for each flightline in *.bil format\n\n /sensor_FOV_vectors\n\n Field Of View Vectors for each sensor in *.bil format.

These are supplied broken up into three seperate datasets. _RAW idicates level 1b sensor data along with view vector and dem files that enable the raw data to be georeferenced. _PRO is the processed data as supplied by NERC ARSF. These data are mapped to OSGB 1936 as ENVI *.BIL files. _DOC is the accompanying documentation supplied by NERC for each flight. This is the raw data. \n\n The AISA Eagle is a 12 bit, pushbroom, hyperspectral sensor with a 1000 pixel swath width, covering the visible and near infra-red spectrum 400 - 970nm. The maximum spectral resolution of the sensor is 2.9nm. Also output to the Eagle are data from the fibre optic downwelling irradiance sensor (FODIS). Full details of the sensor can be downloaded from Specim's website. The AISA Eagle requires good atmospheric conditions for the collection of narrow spectral wavebands. In the UK we are yet to collect data better that 2.5nm bandwidth (spectrally binning by 2). In less than perfect illumination or atmospheric conditions the instrument may require spectral and/or spatial binning to allow data to be collected. Should perfect optical conditions be essential for your project then there can be no guarantee that these conditions may coincide with the availability of the aircraft in a single flying season. If this project depends on its support in the flying season immediately following the year of submission (or if spectral quality is less of a concern) then additional guidance concerning spatial and spectral binning should be sought. \n\n The AISA Hawk is a 14 bit sensor able to capture short wave infrared wavelengths, 970 - 2450nm. This makes the Hawk an ideal tool for data acquisition on spectral signatures characteristic to chemical compounds and man-made targets that can not be distinguished using the Eagle instrument. The Hawk has 320 spatial pixels, 244 spectral pixels and a maximum spectral resolution of 8nm. Full details of the sensor can be downloaded from Specim's website. \n\n This dataset contains \n\n /dem \n\n An ASTER DEM of the area fo georeferencing the data \n\n /fodis \n\n data from the fodis sensor used for atmospheric correction in *.bil format \n\n /level1b\n\n the raw, un georeferenced imagery from the fligthline and masks of bad pixels in *.bil format for both eagle and hawk.\n\n /line_information\n\n XML metadata for each flightline\n\n /navigation\n\n navigation information for each flightline in *.bil format\n\n /sensor_FOV_vectors\n\n Field Of View Vectors for each sensor in *.bil format.

The maximum spectral resolution of the sensor is 2.9nm. Also output to the Eagle are data from the fibre optic downwelling irradiance sensor (FODIS). Full details of the sensor can be downloaded from Specim's website. The AISA Eagle requires good atmospheric conditions for the collection of narrow spectral wavebands.

Should perfect optical conditions be essential for your project then there can be no guarantee that these conditions may coincide with the availability of the aircraft in a single flying season. If this project depends on its support in the flying season immediately following the year of submission (or if spectral quality is less of a concern) then additional guidance concerning spatial and spectral binning should be sought. \n\n The AISA Hawk is a 14 bit sensor able to capture short wave infrared wavelengths, 970 - 2450nm. This makes the Hawk an ideal tool for data acquisition on spectral signatures characteristic to chemical compounds and man-made targets that can not be distinguished using the Eagle instrument.
