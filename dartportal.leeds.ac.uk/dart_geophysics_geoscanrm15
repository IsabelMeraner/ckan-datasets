The survey is part of a monthly programme of data collection over 2011-2012.   \n\n Resistance Meter used: Geoscan RM15: These instruments measure the electrical resistance of the earth, using a system of four electrodes (two current and two potential).  Depending on the arrangement of these electrodes an exact measurement of a specific volume of earth may be acquired.  This resistance value may then be used to calculate the earth resistivity.  The most common arrangement is the Twin Probe configuration which involves two pairs of electrodes (one current and one potential): one pair of probes ('remote' probes) remain in a fixed position, whilst the other 'mobile' probes measure the resistance variations across a gird.  The resistance is measured in ohms and, when calculated, resistivity is in ohm-metres.  The resistance method as used for this area survey employs probe separations of 0.25m, 0.5m, 0.75m and 1m, which samples an approximate hemisphere between the mobile probes.  Hence, a greater depth of investigation is theoretically possible with a wider probe spacing. The nature of the overburden and underlying geology will cause variations in this depth. \n\n All of the data are stored on an integrated data logger for subsequent post-processing and analysis. The instrument is connected to a computer via a USB-Serial cable and downloaded into Geoplot (Geoscan's in-house processing software). The surveys consist of 10m x 10m grids, and for this survey, measurements from the sensor/probes were logged at intervals of 0.5m along traverses spaced 0.5m apart. This gives 400 measurements per grid.   Data are outputted as .CSV text files. \n\n Filenames are arranged first by the project (DART), then by instrument (GeoscanRM15), then by field (either DDPF, DDCF, HHCC, HHQF), then by date (YYYYMMDD), then by category (RAW or PRO), then by the mobile probe spacing (A=0.25m, B=0.5m, C=0.75m, D=1m). \n\n The RM15 resistance meter provides current ranges of 1mA to 0.1mA at an output voltage of 40V, giving  a maximum logged resolution of 0.005 ohms.

The survey is part of a monthly programme of data collection over 2011-2012.   \n\n Resistance Meter used: Geoscan RM15: These instruments measure the electrical resistance of the earth, using a system of four electrodes (two current and two potential).  Depending on the arrangement of these electrodes an exact measurement of a specific volume of earth may be acquired.  This resistance value may then be used to calculate the earth resistivity.  The most common arrangement is the Twin Probe configuration which involves two pairs of electrodes (one current and one potential): one pair of probes ('remote' probes) remain in a fixed position, whilst the other 'mobile' probes measure the resistance variations across a gird.  The resistance is measured in ohms and, when calculated, resistivity is in ohm-metres.  The resistance method as used for this area survey employs probe separations of 0.25m, 0.5m, 0.75m and 1m, which samples an approximate hemisphere between the mobile probes.  Hence, a greater depth of investigation is theoretically possible with a wider probe spacing. The nature of the overburden and underlying geology will cause variations in this depth. \n\n All of the data are stored on an integrated data logger for subsequent post-processing and analysis. The instrument is connected to a computer via a USB-Serial cable and downloaded into Geoplot (Geoscan's in-house processing software). The surveys consist of 10m x 10m grids, and for this survey, measurements from the sensor/probes were logged at intervals of 0.5m along traverses spaced 0.5m apart. This gives 400 measurements per grid.   Data are outputted as .CSV text files. \n\n Filenames are arranged first by the project (DART), then by instrument (GeoscanRM15), then by field (either DDPF, DDCF, HHCC, HHQF), then by date (YYYYMMDD), then by category (RAW or PRO), then by the mobile probe spacing (A=0.25m, B=0.5m, C=0.75m, D=1m). \n\n The RM15 resistance meter provides current ranges of 1mA to 0.1mA at an output voltage of 40V, giving  a maximum logged resolution of 0.005 ohms.  The operating frequency of 137Hz prevents the instrument to being affected by power line operating frequencies  and harmonics.
